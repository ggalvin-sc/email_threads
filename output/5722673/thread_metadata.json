DuPont has been leading the global effort to reduce PFOA in the \n          environment and at the end of 2005, we have already reduced emissions by 94%.  \n          PFOA is a process aid. As such, most of our finished products contain no PFOA in them.  \n          DuPont has a website that discusses PFOA in detail at \n          http://www2.dupont.com/PFOA/en_US/index.html. \n           \n          Extensive testing has been done in the industry and there are no documented cases of serious human \n          health effects. Because PFOA is persistant and does not bio-degrade, DuPont has led the industry to \n          remove it from our products. \n          Attached is a recent press announcement from DuPont in regards to the EPA's voluntary program. \n          [attachment \"VERSP Press Release 1 25 06 LTR.pdf\" deleted by Richard L Bell/AE/DuPont] \n          Rick Bell\n          DuPont\n          950 Stephenson Hwy\n          Troy, MI 48083\n          248-583-4561\n     David W Boothe/AE/DuPont\n               David \n               W \n               Boothe/\n               AE/DuP\n               ont \n               03/22/20\n               06 11:33 \n               AM\n                         To\n                         Richard L Bell/AE/DuPont@DuPont\n                         cc\n                         John W Moriarty/DuPont@DuPont, Robert C Buck/DuPont@DuPont, L William \n                         Buxton/DuPont@DuPont, William P Raiford/CL/DuPont@DuPont, Andrew M \n                         Weber/AE/DuPont@DuPont, John D Colven/PO/DuPont@DuPont\n                    Subject\n                         Fw: PFOA Actions\n          Rick,\n          The DCSE folks are correct--this is an inquiry we need to field from Ford as soon as possible.

DuPont has been leading the global effort to reduce PFOA in the \n          environment and at the end of 2005, we have already reduced emissions by 94%.  \n          PFOA is a process aid. As such, most of our finished products contain no PFOA in them.  \n          DuPont has a website that discusses PFOA in detail at \n          http://www2.dupont.com/PFOA/en_US/index.html. \n           \n          Extensive testing has been done in the industry and there are no documented cases of serious human \n          health effects. Because PFOA is persistant and does not bio-degrade, DuPont has led the industry to \n          remove it from our products. \n          Attached is a recent press announcement from DuPont in regards to the EPA's voluntary program. \n          [attachment \"VERSP Press Release 1 25 06 LTR.pdf\" deleted by Richard L Bell/AE/DuPont] \n          Rick Bell\n          DuPont\n          950 Stephenson Hwy\n          Troy, MI 48083\n          248-583-4561\n     David W Boothe/AE/DuPont\n               David \n               W \n               Boothe/\n               AE/DuP\n               ont \n               03/22/20\n               06 11:33 \n               AM\n                         To\n                         Richard L Bell/AE/DuPont@DuPont\n                         cc\n                         John W Moriarty/DuPont@DuPont, Robert C Buck/DuPont@DuPont, L William \n                         Buxton/DuPont@DuPont, William P Raiford/CL/DuPont@DuPont, Andrew M \n                         Weber/AE/DuPont@DuPont, John D Colven/PO/DuPont@DuPont\n                    Subject\n                         Fw: PFOA Actions\n          Rick,\n          The DCSE folks are correct--this is an inquiry we need to field from Ford as soon as possible.

DuPont has been leading the global effort to reduce PFOA in the \n          environment and at the end of 2005, we have already reduced emissions by 94%.  \n          PFOA is a process aid. As such, most of our finished products contain no PFOA in them.  \n          DuPont has a website that discusses PFOA in detail at \n          http://www2.dupont.com/PFOA/en_US/index.html. \n           \n          Extensive testing has been done in the industry and there are no documented cases of serious human \n          health effects. Because PFOA is persistant and does not bio-degrade, DuPont has led the industry to \n          remove it from our products. \n          Attached is a recent press announcement from DuPont in regards to the EPA's voluntary program. \n          [attachment \"VERSP Press Release 1 25 06 LTR.pdf\" deleted by Richard L Bell/AE/DuPont] \n          Rick Bell\n          DuPont\n          950 Stephenson Hwy\n          Troy, MI 48083\n          248-583-4561\n     David W Boothe/AE/DuPont\n               David \n               W \n               Boothe/\n               AE/DuP\n               ont \n               03/22/20\n               06 11:33 \n               AM\n                         To\n                         Richard L Bell/AE/DuPont@DuPont\n                         cc\n                         John W Moriarty/DuPont@DuPont, Robert C Buck/DuPont@DuPont, L William \n                         Buxton/DuPont@DuPont, William P Raiford/CL/DuPont@DuPont, Andrew M \n                         Weber/AE/DuPont@DuPont, John D Colven/PO/DuPont@DuPont\n                    Subject\n                         Fw: PFOA Actions\n          Rick,\n          The DCSE folks are correct--this is an inquiry we need to field from Ford as soon as possible.
