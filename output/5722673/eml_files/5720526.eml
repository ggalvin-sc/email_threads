          Rick,
          It's great that you got back to them so quickly, but there are a couple of issues with your messaging.  
          Please give me a call and I'll work through these with you.  I expect this won't be the last one, so let's talk 
          about our process for fielding these inquiries in writing (the language of which requires corporate 
          approval) as they come in the future, as well as any further clarification that may be required for Ford on 
          this one.  I look forward to hearing from you.
          Thanks & Regards
          Dave

          Done!
          I sent a reply two days ago and copied everyone that was on the original E-mail. For reference, attached 
          is a copy of my reply. We are also in direct contact with Ford's Toxicity group through the GADSL 
          committee (Global Automotive Declarable Substance List). This is the group that would handle any 
          materials of concern.

          I'm the Automotive Segment Manager for DuPont's Fluoropolymers such as Teflon(R) and Tefzel(R) and 
          your primary contact for questions related to PFOAs and the EPA's voluntary reduction program. 
          In reply to the attached E-mail, there will be no supply interruptions with DuPont's Fluoropolymers as 
          PFOA is phased out by 2015. DuPont has been leading the global effort to reduce PFOA in the 
          environment and at the end of 2005, we have already reduced emissions by 94%.  
          PFOA is a process aid. As such, most of our finished products contain no PFOA in them.  
          DuPont has a website that discusses PFOA in detail at 
          http://www2.dupont.com/PFOA/en_US/index.html. 
           
          Extensive testing has been done in the industry and there are no documented cases of serious human 
          health effects. Because PFOA is persistant and does not bio-degrade, DuPont has led the industry to 
          remove it from our products. 
          Attached is a recent press announcement from DuPont in regards to the EPA's voluntary program.

          Rick,
          The DCSE folks are correct--this is an inquiry we need to field from Ford as soon as possible.  Can you 
          please work with the "usual suspects"  (Buxton and/or Raiford) to answer.  Call me if you need to discuss 
          further.
          Thanks

          Let's start with what does Ford buy from DuPont in terms of either Fluorpolymer or Fluorotelomers?  
          Particularly for the ATEO uses.
          If that data is handy then it is easier to move in the right direction.
          I will help however I can.

          Is there any risk to ATEO with (PFOA)Perfluorooctanoic acid.  There may be a possible ban on using the 
          material by 2015.  Pleae get with your chemists and Tox people to see if there will be any future issues.  
          It is used in the manufacture of certain fluoropolymers.  Please report back.
