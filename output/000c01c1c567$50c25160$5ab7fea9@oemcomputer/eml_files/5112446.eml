Dr. Geisy,
I got your name from an Amer. Chem. Society Abstract on tissue tests for PFOS.   I have a client in the Wash. DC area that desires to have human blood analyzed for PFOS.   I am not sure of the number of samples: however, if your lab would be interested in performing these tests, than I will get more details.  Please let me know ASAP of your interest.
Regards,
Joseph Fortuna, President Chemical Detection Services, Inc. 7240 F Telegraph Sq. Dr. Lorton, Va 22079
