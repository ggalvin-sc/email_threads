Good morning,Geary,congratulations to you and your colleagues for the fine job on this document. I've been very deliberate in reading the paper in order to better comprehend its contents. Hope we have a chance to discuss at some future time.
In the meanwhile, take care and try to stay in out of the snow.
Best regards,
David

David,

FYI per our prior discussions, see the link below to the phase 1 clinical trial of PFOA manuscript that was just published as advance access in Toxicological Sciences. It is an OPEN ACCESS link so you will be able to open up the pdf without any problem.
