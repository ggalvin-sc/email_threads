David,
Snow? What snow? I am in Phoenix celebrating my motherâ€™s 98th birthday. Just hope the snow is melted when I return on Monday OR that my significant other was able to start our JOhn Deere 3520 utility tractor to snow blow our 0.3 mile driveway. She is the pro at this task.
Perry was going to contact journal to find out where journal stands with 2nd review of our paper. It has been awhile.

David,

FYI per our prior discussions, see the link below to the phase 1 clinical trial of PFOA manuscript that was just published as advance access in Toxicological Sciences. It is an OPEN ACCESS link so you will be able to open up the pdf without any problem.
