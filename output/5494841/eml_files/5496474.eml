 In reply to your email to Pim I send you hereby the part of the report that is dealing with the                                                 
                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                 
 selected endpoints. Three chapters are not finalised yet, that is Chapter 6, 21 and 22. In addition                                             
 there are a few lines/words highlighted in yellow. I still need to add some information there.                                                  
 Maybe I can suggest a reply before 17th of november on the endpoints you have selected. Please                                                  
 give some attention to the tabulated data on their correctness as far as you can.
