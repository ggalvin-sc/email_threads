 In reply to your email to Pirn I send you hereby the part of the report that is dealing with the                                               
                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                
 selected endpoints. Three chapters are not finalised yet, that is Chapter 6, 21 and 22. In addition                                            
 there are a few lines/words highlighted in yellow. I still need to add some information there.                                                 
 Maybe I can suggest a reply before 17th of november on the endpoints you have selected. Please                                                 
 give some attention to the tabulated data on their correctness as far as you can.

 is responsible for collecting phys-chem parameters of perfluorocompounds                
 from the literature and make a critical evaluation of the parameter data                
 provided.                                                                               
 I would be much obliged if you or one of your colleagues would be                       
 available for reviewing some of the draft parameter chapters that we                    
 have                                                                                    
 made so far. Could you please indicate if you are available for such a                  
 review and if so, for which parameters you could act as a reviewer?
