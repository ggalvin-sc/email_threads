We are sharing the SPRIM cost.  So, please reduce \n          your PA budget to $500M vs. the earlier budget figure of $750M.  Renee, the MC amount for FLPR is still \n          $375M.  The PA budget is expected to cover ongoing monitoring and tracking, media events and \n          response (minimizing news cycles and scope).   The MC budget is for brand sustainability and brand \n          defense.  \n          The next step is to work through our managing process for the budget.

We are sharing the SPRIM cost.  So, please reduce \n          your PA budget to $500M vs. the earlier budget figure of $750M.  Renee, the MC amount for FLPR is still \n          $375M.  The PA budget is expected to cover ongoing monitoring and tracking, media events and \n          response (minimizing news cycles and scope).   The MC budget is for brand sustainability and brand \n          defense.  \n          The next step is to work through our managing process for the budget.  I suggest we speak next week to \n          get that discussion started.  I have some thoughts, but I would like to hear how you, Gaston and Renee \n          think the process could be managed.

We are sharing the SPRIM cost.  So, please reduce \n          your PA budget to $500M vs. the earlier budget figure of $750M.  Renee, the MC amount for FLPR is still \n          $375M.  The PA budget is expected to cover ongoing monitoring and tracking, media events and \n          response (minimizing news cycles and scope).   The MC budget is for brand sustainability and brand \n          defense.  \n          The next step is to work through our managing process for the budget.  I suggest we speak next week to \n          get that discussion started.  I have some thoughts, but I would like to hear how you, Gaston and Renee \n          think the process could be managed. I'll ask Joan to get some time on the calendar.\n          Take care,\n          Jayne\n          Jayne vanDusen\n          (c) 919-619-5331\n          Jayne.S.VanDusen@usa.dupont.com",
