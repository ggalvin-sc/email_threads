          Jayne,
          In reply to your e-mail dated January 25, I am attaching-in blue- "old" e-mail on the subject, for our 
          teleconference today at 10AM your time on budgets,
          (see also the word document in Susan's e-mail dated November 9)
          I am afraid there may be  some confusion about budgets.Europe needs a budget , not only for Sprim but 
          also for the people working on the issue ..(see the word document attached in the e-mail of Susan 
          Stalnecker dated November 9)
          The Sprim contract is 400M $ plus their travel expenses still for this year.I addition we have the people 
          dedicated to the issue: myself(50%) Alex (50%) and James (100%). In addition several other people are 
          working part time on the issue,(regulatory and tox) 
          It had been my understanding that the budget for crisis communications was dedicated to this
          let's sort tit out later today,
          regards,Gaston,
          Hi Gaston.
          I can now answer  some of your question.  Indeed, we did receive the approval to proceed with the 
          communications budget, including Alex's charges (is he 50% to our budget or 100%?).  For the European 
          Communications budget, we will have the following:
          - Crisis Communications (i.e., PA)  -- $.75MM ($750,000)
          - Brand Defense (i.e., MC & PR) -- $.75MM (to be shared between FPS and DCSE to keep the brand 
          safe)
          It may be best to arrange a call to discuss the intentions of both Communications budgets so that we are 
          all clear on expectations of the use of the budgets and the process to get approval to spend.  This call 
          should be within the next couple of weeks.  I propose I visit your team in January to plan for 2007 and 
          discuss managing processes.  This would also include Renee and Martin.
            
          Please let me know if you have thoughts/comments on the above.  
          Thanks.

          Gaston, thank you for your note. I don't really feel I can respond as yet because I have not gotten into the 
          details of the budget.  I will look into this and respond as soon as possible. Do you have a must have 
          date?

          In below communication, Susan had been asking for confirmation of next year's budgets.
          So far I have not yet received  any further news,
          Since our commitments (Sprim & other) have been agreed already this year for a 2 years period, I am 
          anxious to get confirmation of the for Europe in 2007 for Issue Management,
          Are you in a position to confirm my budget ?
          Thanks for your help, Gaston

          Dear Susan:
          Catching up to wrap up 2007 budget discussions, I have been reminded  to confirm funding for the Issue 
          management activities in 2007 (Alex, James, SPRIM etc.). Did you get confirmation from Ellen and for 
          which amount so that I can reconcile with Gaston (on vacation this week) and our Financial analyst.. to 
          avoid both doublebookings or "falls in the cracks".  If there is anybody else we should now be talking to 
          (Tom Rossiter, Jayne, Kathy?), just  let us know..
          Thanks and again best wishes in your new assignment!

          I have not heard back from Ellen as to whether she went with this but I 
          am pretty sure she did.  Thanks

          Alex,
          Kathy and I discussed the European Budget today.  We are sharing the SPRIM cost.  So, please reduce 
          your PA budget to $500M vs. the earlier budget figure of $750M.  Renee, the MC amount for FLPR is still 
          $375M.  The PA budget is expected to cover ongoing monitoring and tracking, media events and 
          response (minimizing news cycles and scope).   The MC budget is for brand sustainability and brand 
          defense.  
          The next step is to work through our managing process for the budget.  I suggest we speak next week to 
          get that discussion started.  I have some thoughts, but I would like to hear how you, Gaston and Renee 
          think the process could be managed. I'll ask Joan to get some time on the calendar.
          Take care,
          Jayne
