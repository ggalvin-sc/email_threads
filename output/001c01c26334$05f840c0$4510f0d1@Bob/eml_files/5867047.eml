          Andrew,
          Unfortunately, they have given us the hourly details for August 20, 2002.  We actually need this 
          information for the next day, August 21, 2002, which is the day that the water levels were measured.  Can 
          we make another request?  It is important that I have this information for the model due to the rapid 
          response of the aquifer to changes in pumping stress.
          Thanks,
          Mike

          Steve,
          As requested, I have attached our wellfield pumping data for the month of
          August 2002.  Please note that this data is normally recorded at about 8:00
          to 10:00 AM each day.  Therefore, data recorded for August 9th is actually
          for pumpage from about 9:00 AM August 8th to about 9:00 AM August 9th.
          The pumping data for Tuesday, August 20, 2002, was taken from a totalizer
          chart (midnight August 19th to midnight August 20th), and is as follows:
          00:00 to 06:30     680 gpm (Wells 2&3)
          06:30 to 11:00         0 gpm (All wells were off)
          11:00 to 13:15     700 gpm (Wells 2&3)
          13:15 to 24:00     910 gpm (Wells 1, 2, & 3)
          As soon as the GPS data is available, either Linda or I will forward it to
          you.
          Have a good day.
          Regards,
          Bob

          Bob,
          DuPont has requested that I pass the following information request to you:
          GPS Data (collected by B&W) for soil boring locations (and all other
          locations if available) for the creation of maps, etc.
          and,  Pumping Rates, daily for August 5-19, and hourly for Aug. 20.  Needed
          to finalize the ground water flow model calibration.
          Let me know if you have any question on this request.  I could forward to
          DuPont if you would like.
          Steve
