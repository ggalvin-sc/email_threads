          Steve,
          As requested, I have attached our wellfield pumping data for the month of
          August 2002.  Please note that this data is normally recorded at about 8:00
          to 10:00 AM each day.  Therefore, data recorded for August 9th is actually
          for pumpage from about 9:00 AM August 8th to about 9:00 AM August 9th.
          The pumping data for Tuesday, August 20, 2002, was taken from a totalizer
          chart (midnight August 19th to midnight August 20th), and is as follows:
          00:00 to 06:30     680 gpm (Wells 2&3)
          06:30 to 11:00         0 gpm (All wells were off)
          11:00 to 13:15     700 gpm (Wells 2&3)
          13:15 to 24:00     910 gpm (Wells 1, 2, & 3)
          As soon as the GPS data is available, either Linda or I will forward it to
          you.
          Have a good day.
          Regards,
          Bob

          Bob,
          DuPont has requested that I pass the following information request to you:
          GPS Data (collected by B&W) for soil boring locations (and all other
          locations if available) for the creation of maps, etc.
          and,  Pumping Rates, daily for August 5-19, and hourly for Aug. 20.  Needed
          to finalize the ground water flow model calibration.
          Let me know if you have any question on this request.  I could forward to
          DuPont if you would like.
          Steve
