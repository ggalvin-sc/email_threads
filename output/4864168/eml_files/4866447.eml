Re: Fwd: interview
Body:
Dale -
I assume you are going to ask Giesy to refer the writer to me?  You can have 
him give her my phone number - 651-733-1135 - or you can have him say that I'll 
call her.  Just let me know which way it will be.  Thanks. 

Rick

Dale, by copy of this memo, I am asking Rick Renner to be the contact. He can 
then determine the scope of the article and whether 3M through Larry Zobel 
would wish to be interviewed.

Larry, any thoughts?

Mike

Call me.  Who should cover this?  You, Mike, John.  Please advise before I get 
back to her.  Since I am not an expert on human health we may want someone else 
to field this one.
