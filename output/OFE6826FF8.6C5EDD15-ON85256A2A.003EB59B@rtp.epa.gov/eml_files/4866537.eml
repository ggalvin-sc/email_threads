DB:

Here is the proposed final program for the SETAC meeting.  I was pretty
successful in what I could negotiate with John.  I got rid of all of the
policy people and got spots for all of our people.  Rich still has a spot,
but politically if we did not let him speak he would make a great deal of
mileage of that in the press.  Best to let him participate and try to keep
him to the straight and narrow based on sound science.  The bal is now in our
court to do a good job.

If I am going to be any help to you I need to be involved in what Hicks does.
 He is not a toxicologist or a chemist and in 15 min can undo a lot of
background that has been laid over the past several years.  It is imperative
that he and I be on the same page and that everything he says is supportable
by sound science and that what he does is by the risk assessment process that
the agencies can relate to.  Otherwise we will start a pissing match.  That
is a road we do not want to go down.  We need to educate teh regulators not
enrage them.
