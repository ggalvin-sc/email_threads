Therefore, the study will need advance approval from the Animal \nExperimentation  Commission (AEC). Since the study design is still subject to \nchanges as you  indicated, we will await your further information on this \nbefore the study  is submitted to the AEC. The AEC will nontheless require a \nrationale  for conducting the study following the 28-day study which already \nused a  significant higher number of animals than the default number of \nanimals  described in the respective OPPTS guideline. Therefore, we enquired \nfor  more information as to the rationale for the study design and the request \nfor a  90-day study in general. Having this information in advance will speed \nup the  approval procedure significantly. May we therefore kindly ask you to \nprovide  this information to us?\n\nWith  regard to sending a revised draft of the 28-day study, we can inform you \nthat  the report has already been approved for finalisation on 02 January 2007 \n(please  refer to the email sent by Melinda Mitchell). On 4th January however, \nJohn  Butenhoff informed us on the deviating analytical results on test \nsubstance  formulations. We responded that it would be best to await the full \nresults and  analytical report from David Ehresman, and decide what further \nsteps should be  taken (eg correction for lower recovery, repeat analyses \netc.). John replied  that he would discuss the matter with Paul and Dave. So \nfar we have not  received a response from 3M on this topic. \n\nFurther  on the 28-day study report, a further detailed review of the raw data  \nrevealed that recovery group animals at the end of the treatment period were  \ninadvertently not anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor but with isoflurane  \ninstead. Prior to their necropsy however, both Main and Recovery group animals  \nwere anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor. I.e. the wash-out period for any  \nisoflurane metabolites may have been sufficiently long not to have adversely  \naffected the analyses on serum samples collected at the end of the recovery  \nperiod.  We do apologize for this occurrence, and will ensure that this  will \nnot happen in the 90-day study.\n\nWe look  forward to receiving any updates on the study design of the 90-day \nstudy. In the  meantime, please contact us in case of any questions.\n\nWith  best regards,\n\nFrancois\n \n\nMet vriendelijke groeten / With kind  regards,\nNOTOX  B.V.\n\nF.M. van Otterdijk, M.Sc.\nStudy Director  Toxicology\nHambakenwetering 7\nP.O.

Has the study been  initiated and approved by EPA/State  of  \nMinnesota? \n\nTo my best  knowledge, the study will be based on the following EPA guideline \non 90-day  study in rats.  I will double check to make sure this is correct.  \n\nUnited States Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA). Health Effects Test \nGuidelines, OPPTS 870-3100,  90-day oral toxicity in rodents. Office of \nPrevention, Pesticides and Toxic  Substances (7101), EPA 712-C-98-199, July \n2000. \n\nI am attaching the guideline document below for  your reference. \n\n\n\n  \nHow much  serum should be collected, and  from how many animals/group?  \n\nSimilar to our 28-day  study, blood samples from all animals (probably \nn=20/sex/group) will be  collected after last treatment so that clinical \nchemistries, hematology, and  clotting tests (like we did for the 28-day study) \ncan be determined at the end  of treatment.  Half of the rats will be \nsubsequentlhy sacrificed at the  end of treatment while the other half will be \nretained for another 21 days as  recovery. \n\nCollection from  aorta as part of necropsy  ok, or on a specific time point \nafter the last  dose on day 90?   \n\nYes, blood collection from aorta is fine at necropsy.  Let's use  the same time \nschedules that were employed in our 28-day study.  \n\nAttn to whom should these serum  samples  be sent?   \n\nSimilar to before, batches of flash-frozen livers and serum, as well as  the \ncacodylate-fixed liver tissues shall be sent to: \n\nDave Ehresman (phone:  651-733-5070, fax:   651-737-4754, e-mail: \ndjehresman@mmm.com) \n3M Company \n3M Center \n236-C148  \nSt. Paul, MN  55144  \nUSA \n\nRNA-later preserved liver samples shall be sent  to: \n\nKen Wallace (phone:   218-726-8899, fax:  218-726-8014, e-mail: \nkwallace@d.umn.edu  \nDepartement of Biochemistry&  Molecular Biology \nUniversity of  Minnesota Medical School \n1035  University Drive \nDuluth, MN  55812 \nUSA \n\nShould animals be anaesthesized with   Ketamin/Dormitor as done for the 28-day \nstudy? \n\nYes \n\nIn the 28-day study we collected liver  samples for analyses to  be conducted \nat 3M/Minnesota University. Did these  analyses reveal any  findings that may \nbe useful for the dose selection?  Apparently, in the  90-day study no \nadditional liver samples have to be   collected? \n\nSee  above, we will be interested in having the livers collected at this \npoint.    \n\nSprague Dawley rats  were used in the  28-day study. Wistar rats were mentioned \nin the  90-d quotation. Is this  correct? \n\nSprague Dawley rats should be used, not  Wistar. \n\nBased on the  28-day study results, we  suggest to use 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day as \ndosages  for the 90-day study. Dosages  in the 28-day study were 6, 30 and 150  \nmg/kg/day. At 30 mg/kg/day, males  showed notably increased liver weights  (27% \nincrease towards control animals),  along with  hyperthrophy/hyperplasia of the \nthyroid and increased cholesterol   levels.  The amount of test substance left \nis approx  500  grams. Based on suggested dosages  specified below approx. 40 \ngrams  would be required. I.e. no need to send  additional test  substance. \n\nAs mentioned  earlier, we have not firmed up the plan yet.  But I will have \nadditional  test material (~ 200 g or so) send to your facility. \n\n_____________________________________________\nSue  Tanaka\n3M Corporate Toxicology and Regulatory Services\nMail: Bldg  220-6E-03, St. Paul, MN  55144\nLab:  Bldg 270-3S-06, St. Paul, MN  55144\nTel:      651-733-9073\nFax:      651-736-2214\nE-mail: stanaka@mmm.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTOXUSA@aol.com   \n\n01/19/2007 09:01 AM \n\t\n\t\n\tTo\n\tstanaka@mmm.com  \n\tcc\n\tjlbutenhoff@mmm.com\n\tfrancois.van.otterdijk@notox.nl\n\tchris.de.ries@notox.nl  \n\tSubject\n\tFwd: 3M Revised Quote -90-day  Q.06.2022, ts 168273\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nHi  Sue \n  \nThanks for the  authorization to proceed with the 90-day  study.

Therefore, the study will need advance approval from the Animal \nExperimentation  Commission (AEC). Since the study design is still subject to \nchanges as you  indicated, we will await your further information on this \nbefore the study  is submitted to the AEC. The AEC will nontheless require a \nrationale  for conducting the study following the 28-day study which already \nused a  significant higher number of animals than the default number of \nanimals  described in the respective OPPTS guideline. Therefore, we enquired \nfor  more information as to the rationale for the study design and the request \nfor a  90-day study in general. Having this information in advance will speed \nup the  approval procedure significantly. May we therefore kindly ask you to \nprovide  this information to us?\n\nWith  regard to sending a revised draft of the 28-day study, we can inform you \nthat  the report has already been approved for finalisation on 02 January 2007 \n(please  refer to the email sent by Melinda Mitchell). On 4th January however, \nJohn  Butenhoff informed us on the deviating analytical results on test \nsubstance  formulations. We responded that it would be best to await the full \nresults and  analytical report from David Ehresman, and decide what further \nsteps should be  taken (eg correction for lower recovery, repeat analyses \netc.). John replied  that he would discuss the matter with Paul and Dave. So \nfar we have not  received a response from 3M on this topic. \n\nFurther  on the 28-day study report, a further detailed review of the raw data  \nrevealed that recovery group animals at the end of the treatment period were  \ninadvertently not anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor but with isoflurane  \ninstead. Prior to their necropsy however, both Main and Recovery group animals  \nwere anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor. I.e. the wash-out period for any  \nisoflurane metabolites may have been sufficiently long not to have adversely  \naffected the analyses on serum samples collected at the end of the recovery  \nperiod.  We do apologize for this occurrence, and will ensure that this  will \nnot happen in the 90-day study.\n\nWe look  forward to receiving any updates on the study design of the 90-day \nstudy. In the  meantime, please contact us in case of any questions.\n\nWith  best regards,\n\nFrancois\n \n\nMet vriendelijke groeten / With kind  regards,\nNOTOX  B.V.\n\nF.M. van Otterdijk, M.Sc.\nStudy Director  Toxicology\nHambakenwetering 7\nP.O.

Has the study been  initiated and approved by EPA/State  of  \nMinnesota? \n\nTo my best  knowledge, the study will be based on the following EPA guideline \non 90-day  study in rats.  I will double check to make sure this is correct.  \n\nUnited States Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA). Health Effects Test \nGuidelines, OPPTS 870-3100,  90-day oral toxicity in rodents. Office of \nPrevention, Pesticides and Toxic  Substances (7101), EPA 712-C-98-199, July \n2000. \n\nI am attaching the guideline document below for  your reference. \n\n\n\n  \nHow much  serum should be collected, and  from how many animals/group?  \n\nSimilar to our 28-day  study, blood samples from all animals (probably \nn=20/sex/group) will be  collected after last treatment so that clinical \nchemistries, hematology, and  clotting tests (like we did for the 28-day study) \ncan be determined at the end  of treatment.  Half of the rats will be \nsubsequentlhy sacrificed at the  end of treatment while the other half will be \nretained for another 21 days as  recovery. \n\nCollection from  aorta as part of necropsy  ok, or on a specific time point \nafter the last  dose on day 90?   \n\nYes, blood collection from aorta is fine at necropsy.  Let's use  the same time \nschedules that were employed in our 28-day study.  \n\nAttn to whom should these serum  samples  be sent?   \n\nSimilar to before, batches of flash-frozen livers and serum, as well as  the \ncacodylate-fixed liver tissues shall be sent to: \n\nDave Ehresman (phone:  651-733-5070, fax:   651-737-4754, e-mail: \ndjehresman@mmm.com) \n3M Company \n3M Center \n236-C148  \nSt. Paul, MN  55144  \nUSA \n\nRNA-later preserved liver samples shall be sent  to: \n\nKen Wallace (phone:   218-726-8899, fax:  218-726-8014, e-mail: \nkwallace@d.umn.edu  \nDepartement of Biochemistry&  Molecular Biology \nUniversity of  Minnesota Medical School \n1035  University Drive \nDuluth, MN  55812 \nUSA \n\nShould animals be anaesthesized with   Ketamin/Dormitor as done for the 28-day \nstudy? \n\nYes \n\nIn the 28-day study we collected liver  samples for analyses to  be conducted \nat 3M/Minnesota University. Did these  analyses reveal any  findings that may \nbe useful for the dose selection?  Apparently, in the  90-day study no \nadditional liver samples have to be   collected? \n\nSee  above, we will be interested in having the livers collected at this \npoint.    \n\nSprague Dawley rats  were used in the  28-day study. Wistar rats were mentioned \nin the  90-d quotation. Is this  correct? \n\nSprague Dawley rats should be used, not  Wistar. \n\nBased on the  28-day study results, we  suggest to use 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day as \ndosages  for the 90-day study. Dosages  in the 28-day study were 6, 30 and 150  \nmg/kg/day. At 30 mg/kg/day, males  showed notably increased liver weights  (27% \nincrease towards control animals),  along with  hyperthrophy/hyperplasia of the \nthyroid and increased cholesterol   levels.  The amount of test substance left \nis approx  500  grams. Based on suggested dosages  specified below approx. 40 \ngrams  would be required. I.e. no need to send  additional test  substance. \n\nAs mentioned  earlier, we have not firmed up the plan yet.  But I will have \nadditional  test material (~ 200 g or so) send to your facility. \n\n_____________________________________________\nSue  Tanaka\n3M Corporate Toxicology and Regulatory Services\nMail: Bldg  220-6E-03, St. Paul, MN  55144\nLab:  Bldg 270-3S-06, St. Paul, MN  55144\nTel:      651-733-9073\nFax:      651-736-2214\nE-mail: stanaka@mmm.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTOXUSA@aol.com   \n\n01/19/2007 09:01 AM \n\t\n\t\n\tTo\n\tstanaka@mmm.com  \n\tcc\n\tjlbutenhoff@mmm.com\n\tfrancois.van.otterdijk@notox.nl\n\tchris.de.ries@notox.nl  \n\tSubject\n\tFwd: 3M Revised Quote -90-day  Q.06.2022, ts 168273\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nHi  Sue \n  \nThanks for the  authorization to proceed with the 90-day  study.

Therefore, the study will need advance approval from the Animal \nExperimentation  Commission (AEC). Since the study design is still subject to \nchanges as you  indicated, we will await your further information on this \nbefore the study  is submitted to the AEC. The AEC will nontheless require a \nrationale  for conducting the study following the 28-day study which already \nused a  significant higher number of animals than the default number of \nanimals  described in the respective OPPTS guideline. Therefore, we enquired \nfor  more information as to the rationale for the study design and the request \nfor a  90-day study in general. Having this information in advance will speed \nup the  approval procedure significantly. May we therefore kindly ask you to \nprovide  this information to us?\n\nWith  regard to sending a revised draft of the 28-day study, we can inform you \nthat  the report has already been approved for finalisation on 02 January 2007 \n(please  refer to the email sent by Melinda Mitchell). On 4th January however, \nJohn  Butenhoff informed us on the deviating analytical results on test \nsubstance  formulations. We responded that it would be best to await the full \nresults and  analytical report from David Ehresman, and decide what further \nsteps should be  taken (eg correction for lower recovery, repeat analyses \netc.). John replied  that he would discuss the matter with Paul and Dave. So \nfar we have not  received a response from 3M on this topic. \n\nFurther  on the 28-day study report, a further detailed review of the raw data  \nrevealed that recovery group animals at the end of the treatment period were  \ninadvertently not anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor but with isoflurane  \ninstead. Prior to their necropsy however, both Main and Recovery group animals  \nwere anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor. I.e. the wash-out period for any  \nisoflurane metabolites may have been sufficiently long not to have adversely  \naffected the analyses on serum samples collected at the end of the recovery  \nperiod.  We do apologize for this occurrence, and will ensure that this  will \nnot happen in the 90-day study.\n\nWe look  forward to receiving any updates on the study design of the 90-day \nstudy. In the  meantime, please contact us in case of any questions.\n\nWith  best regards,\n\nFrancois\n \n\nMet vriendelijke groeten / With kind  regards,\nNOTOX  B.V.\n\nF.M. van Otterdijk, M.Sc.\nStudy Director  Toxicology\nHambakenwetering 7\nP.O.

Has the study been  initiated and approved by EPA/State  of  \nMinnesota? \n\nTo my best  knowledge, the study will be based on the following EPA guideline \non 90-day  study in rats.  I will double check to make sure this is correct.  \n\nUnited States Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA). Health Effects Test \nGuidelines, OPPTS 870-3100,  90-day oral toxicity in rodents. Office of \nPrevention, Pesticides and Toxic  Substances (7101), EPA 712-C-98-199, July \n2000. \n\nI am attaching the guideline document below for  your reference. \n\n\n\n  \nHow much  serum should be collected, and  from how many animals/group?  \n\nSimilar to our 28-day  study, blood samples from all animals (probably \nn=20/sex/group) will be  collected after last treatment so that clinical \nchemistries, hematology, and  clotting tests (like we did for the 28-day study) \ncan be determined at the end  of treatment.  Half of the rats will be \nsubsequentlhy sacrificed at the  end of treatment while the other half will be \nretained for another 21 days as  recovery. \n\nCollection from  aorta as part of necropsy  ok, or on a specific time point \nafter the last  dose on day 90?   \n\nYes, blood collection from aorta is fine at necropsy.  Let's use  the same time \nschedules that were employed in our 28-day study.  \n\nAttn to whom should these serum  samples  be sent?   \n\nSimilar to before, batches of flash-frozen livers and serum, as well as  the \ncacodylate-fixed liver tissues shall be sent to: \n\nDave Ehresman (phone:  651-733-5070, fax:   651-737-4754, e-mail: \ndjehresman@mmm.com) \n3M Company \n3M Center \n236-C148  \nSt. Paul, MN  55144  \nUSA \n\nRNA-later preserved liver samples shall be sent  to: \n\nKen Wallace (phone:   218-726-8899, fax:  218-726-8014, e-mail: \nkwallace@d.umn.edu  \nDepartement of Biochemistry&  Molecular Biology \nUniversity of  Minnesota Medical School \n1035  University Drive \nDuluth, MN  55812 \nUSA \n\nShould animals be anaesthesized with   Ketamin/Dormitor as done for the 28-day \nstudy? \n\nYes \n\nIn the 28-day study we collected liver  samples for analyses to  be conducted \nat 3M/Minnesota University. Did these  analyses reveal any  findings that may \nbe useful for the dose selection?  Apparently, in the  90-day study no \nadditional liver samples have to be   collected? \n\nSee  above, we will be interested in having the livers collected at this \npoint.    \n\nSprague Dawley rats  were used in the  28-day study. Wistar rats were mentioned \nin the  90-d quotation. Is this  correct? \n\nSprague Dawley rats should be used, not  Wistar. \n\nBased on the  28-day study results, we  suggest to use 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day as \ndosages  for the 90-day study. Dosages  in the 28-day study were 6, 30 and 150  \nmg/kg/day. At 30 mg/kg/day, males  showed notably increased liver weights  (27% \nincrease towards control animals),  along with  hyperthrophy/hyperplasia of the \nthyroid and increased cholesterol   levels.  The amount of test substance left \nis approx  500  grams. Based on suggested dosages  specified below approx. 40 \ngrams  would be required. I.e. no need to send  additional test  substance. \n\nAs mentioned  earlier, we have not firmed up the plan yet.  But I will have \nadditional  test material (~ 200 g or so) send to your facility. \n\n_____________________________________________\nSue  Tanaka\n3M Corporate Toxicology and Regulatory Services\nMail: Bldg  220-6E-03, St. Paul, MN  55144\nLab:  Bldg 270-3S-06, St. Paul, MN  55144\nTel:      651-733-9073\nFax:      651-736-2214\nE-mail: stanaka@mmm.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTOXUSA@aol.com   \n\n01/19/2007 09:01 AM \n\t\n\t\n\tTo\n\tstanaka@mmm.com  \n\tcc\n\tjlbutenhoff@mmm.com\n\tfrancois.van.otterdijk@notox.nl\n\tchris.de.ries@notox.nl  \n\tSubject\n\tFwd: 3M Revised Quote -90-day  Q.06.2022, ts 168273\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nHi  Sue \n  \nThanks for the  authorization to proceed with the 90-day  study.

Therefore, the study will need advance approval from the Animal \nExperimentation  Commission (AEC). Since the study design is still subject to \nchanges as you  indicated, we will await your further information on this \nbefore the study  is submitted to the AEC. The AEC will nontheless require a \nrationale  for conducting the study following the 28-day study which already \nused a  significant higher number of animals than the default number of \nanimals  described in the respective OPPTS guideline. Therefore, we enquired \nfor  more information as to the rationale for the study design and the request \nfor a  90-day study in general. Having this information in advance will speed \nup the  approval procedure significantly. May we therefore kindly ask you to \nprovide  this information to us?\n\nWith  regard to sending a revised draft of the 28-day study, we can inform you \nthat  the report has already been approved for finalisation on 02 January 2007 \n(please  refer to the email sent by Melinda Mitchell). On 4th January however, \nJohn  Butenhoff informed us on the deviating analytical results on test \nsubstance  formulations. We responded that it would be best to await the full \nresults and  analytical report from David Ehresman, and decide what further \nsteps should be  taken (eg correction for lower recovery, repeat analyses \netc.). John replied  that he would discuss the matter with Paul and Dave. So \nfar we have not  received a response from 3M on this topic. \n\nFurther  on the 28-day study report, a further detailed review of the raw data  \nrevealed that recovery group animals at the end of the treatment period were  \ninadvertently not anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor but with isoflurane  \ninstead. Prior to their necropsy however, both Main and Recovery group animals  \nwere anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor. I.e. the wash-out period for any  \nisoflurane metabolites may have been sufficiently long not to have adversely  \naffected the analyses on serum samples collected at the end of the recovery  \nperiod.  We do apologize for this occurrence, and will ensure that this  will \nnot happen in the 90-day study.\n\nWe look  forward to receiving any updates on the study design of the 90-day \nstudy. In the  meantime, please contact us in case of any questions.\n\nWith  best regards,\n\nFrancois\n \n\nMet vriendelijke groeten / With kind  regards,\nNOTOX  B.V.\n\nF.M. van Otterdijk, M.Sc.\nStudy Director  Toxicology\nHambakenwetering 7\nP.O.

Has the study been  initiated and approved by EPA/State  of  \nMinnesota? \n\nTo my best  knowledge, the study will be based on the following EPA guideline \non 90-day  study in rats.  I will double check to make sure this is correct.  \n\nUnited States Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA). Health Effects Test \nGuidelines, OPPTS 870-3100,  90-day oral toxicity in rodents. Office of \nPrevention, Pesticides and Toxic  Substances (7101), EPA 712-C-98-199, July \n2000. \n\nI am attaching the guideline document below for  your reference. \n\n\n\n  \nHow much  serum should be collected, and  from how many animals/group?  \n\nSimilar to our 28-day  study, blood samples from all animals (probably \nn=20/sex/group) will be  collected after last treatment so that clinical \nchemistries, hematology, and  clotting tests (like we did for the 28-day study) \ncan be determined at the end  of treatment.  Half of the rats will be \nsubsequentlhy sacrificed at the  end of treatment while the other half will be \nretained for another 21 days as  recovery. \n\nCollection from  aorta as part of necropsy  ok, or on a specific time point \nafter the last  dose on day 90?   \n\nYes, blood collection from aorta is fine at necropsy.  Let's use  the same time \nschedules that were employed in our 28-day study.  \n\nAttn to whom should these serum  samples  be sent?   \n\nSimilar to before, batches of flash-frozen livers and serum, as well as  the \ncacodylate-fixed liver tissues shall be sent to: \n\nDave Ehresman (phone:  651-733-5070, fax:   651-737-4754, e-mail: \ndjehresman@mmm.com) \n3M Company \n3M Center \n236-C148  \nSt. Paul, MN  55144  \nUSA \n\nRNA-later preserved liver samples shall be sent  to: \n\nKen Wallace (phone:   218-726-8899, fax:  218-726-8014, e-mail: \nkwallace@d.umn.edu  \nDepartement of Biochemistry&  Molecular Biology \nUniversity of  Minnesota Medical School \n1035  University Drive \nDuluth, MN  55812 \nUSA \n\nShould animals be anaesthesized with   Ketamin/Dormitor as done for the 28-day \nstudy? \n\nYes \n\nIn the 28-day study we collected liver  samples for analyses to  be conducted \nat 3M/Minnesota University. Did these  analyses reveal any  findings that may \nbe useful for the dose selection?  Apparently, in the  90-day study no \nadditional liver samples have to be   collected? \n\nSee  above, we will be interested in having the livers collected at this \npoint.    \n\nSprague Dawley rats  were used in the  28-day study. Wistar rats were mentioned \nin the  90-d quotation. Is this  correct? \n\nSprague Dawley rats should be used, not  Wistar. \n\nBased on the  28-day study results, we  suggest to use 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day as \ndosages  for the 90-day study. Dosages  in the 28-day study were 6, 30 and 150  \nmg/kg/day. At 30 mg/kg/day, males  showed notably increased liver weights  (27% \nincrease towards control animals),  along with  hyperthrophy/hyperplasia of the \nthyroid and increased cholesterol   levels.  The amount of test substance left \nis approx  500  grams. Based on suggested dosages  specified below approx. 40 \ngrams  would be required. I.e. no need to send  additional test  substance. \n\nAs mentioned  earlier, we have not firmed up the plan yet.  But I will have \nadditional  test material (~ 200 g or so) send to your facility. \n\n_____________________________________________\nSue  Tanaka\n3M Corporate Toxicology and Regulatory Services\nMail: Bldg  220-6E-03, St. Paul, MN  55144\nLab:  Bldg 270-3S-06, St. Paul, MN  55144\nTel:      651-733-9073\nFax:      651-736-2214\nE-mail: stanaka@mmm.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTOXUSA@aol.com   \n\n01/19/2007 09:01 AM \n\t\n\t\n\tTo\n\tstanaka@mmm.com  \n\tcc\n\tjlbutenhoff@mmm.com\n\tfrancois.van.otterdijk@notox.nl\n\tchris.de.ries@notox.nl  \n\tSubject\n\tFwd: 3M Revised Quote -90-day  Q.06.2022, ts 168273\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nHi  Sue \n  \nThanks for the  authorization to proceed with the 90-day  study.

Therefore, the study will need advance approval from the Animal \nExperimentation  Commission (AEC). Since the study design is still subject to \nchanges as you  indicated, we will await your further information on this \nbefore the study  is submitted to the AEC. The AEC will nontheless require a \nrationale  for conducting the study following the 28-day study which already \nused a  significant higher number of animals than the default number of \nanimals  described in the respective OPPTS guideline. Therefore, we enquired \nfor  more information as to the rationale for the study design and the request \nfor a  90-day study in general. Having this information in advance will speed \nup the  approval procedure significantly. May we therefore kindly ask you to \nprovide  this information to us?\n\nWith  regard to sending a revised draft of the 28-day study, we can inform you \nthat  the report has already been approved for finalisation on 02 January 2007 \n(please  refer to the email sent by Melinda Mitchell). On 4th January however, \nJohn  Butenhoff informed us on the deviating analytical results on test \nsubstance  formulations. We responded that it would be best to await the full \nresults and  analytical report from David Ehresman, and decide what further \nsteps should be  taken (eg correction for lower recovery, repeat analyses \netc.). John replied  that he would discuss the matter with Paul and Dave. So \nfar we have not  received a response from 3M on this topic. \n\nFurther  on the 28-day study report, a further detailed review of the raw data  \nrevealed that recovery group animals at the end of the treatment period were  \ninadvertently not anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor but with isoflurane  \ninstead. Prior to their necropsy however, both Main and Recovery group animals  \nwere anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor. I.e. the wash-out period for any  \nisoflurane metabolites may have been sufficiently long not to have adversely  \naffected the analyses on serum samples collected at the end of the recovery  \nperiod.  We do apologize for this occurrence, and will ensure that this  will \nnot happen in the 90-day study.\n\nWe look  forward to receiving any updates on the study design of the 90-day \nstudy. In the  meantime, please contact us in case of any questions.\n\nWith  best regards,\n\nFrancois\n \n\nMet vriendelijke groeten / With kind  regards,\nNOTOX  B.V.\n\nF.M. van Otterdijk, M.Sc.\nStudy Director  Toxicology\nHambakenwetering 7\nP.O.

Has the study been  initiated and approved by EPA/State  of  \nMinnesota? \n\nTo my best  knowledge, the study will be based on the following EPA guideline \non 90-day  study in rats.  I will double check to make sure this is correct.  \n\nUnited States Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA). Health Effects Test \nGuidelines, OPPTS 870-3100,  90-day oral toxicity in rodents. Office of \nPrevention, Pesticides and Toxic  Substances (7101), EPA 712-C-98-199, July \n2000. \n\nI am attaching the guideline document below for  your reference. \n\n\n\n  \nHow much  serum should be collected, and  from how many animals/group?  \n\nSimilar to our 28-day  study, blood samples from all animals (probably \nn=20/sex/group) will be  collected after last treatment so that clinical \nchemistries, hematology, and  clotting tests (like we did for the 28-day study) \ncan be determined at the end  of treatment.  Half of the rats will be \nsubsequentlhy sacrificed at the  end of treatment while the other half will be \nretained for another 21 days as  recovery. \n\nCollection from  aorta as part of necropsy  ok, or on a specific time point \nafter the last  dose on day 90?   \n\nYes, blood collection from aorta is fine at necropsy.  Let's use  the same time \nschedules that were employed in our 28-day study.  \n\nAttn to whom should these serum  samples  be sent?   \n\nSimilar to before, batches of flash-frozen livers and serum, as well as  the \ncacodylate-fixed liver tissues shall be sent to: \n\nDave Ehresman (phone:  651-733-5070, fax:   651-737-4754, e-mail: \ndjehresman@mmm.com) \n3M Company \n3M Center \n236-C148  \nSt. Paul, MN  55144  \nUSA \n\nRNA-later preserved liver samples shall be sent  to: \n\nKen Wallace (phone:   218-726-8899, fax:  218-726-8014, e-mail: \nkwallace@d.umn.edu  \nDepartement of Biochemistry&  Molecular Biology \nUniversity of  Minnesota Medical School \n1035  University Drive \nDuluth, MN  55812 \nUSA \n\nShould animals be anaesthesized with   Ketamin/Dormitor as done for the 28-day \nstudy? \n\nYes \n\nIn the 28-day study we collected liver  samples for analyses to  be conducted \nat 3M/Minnesota University. Did these  analyses reveal any  findings that may \nbe useful for the dose selection?  Apparently, in the  90-day study no \nadditional liver samples have to be   collected? \n\nSee  above, we will be interested in having the livers collected at this \npoint.    \n\nSprague Dawley rats  were used in the  28-day study. Wistar rats were mentioned \nin the  90-d quotation. Is this  correct? \n\nSprague Dawley rats should be used, not  Wistar. \n\nBased on the  28-day study results, we  suggest to use 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day as \ndosages  for the 90-day study. Dosages  in the 28-day study were 6, 30 and 150  \nmg/kg/day. At 30 mg/kg/day, males  showed notably increased liver weights  (27% \nincrease towards control animals),  along with  hyperthrophy/hyperplasia of the \nthyroid and increased cholesterol   levels.  The amount of test substance left \nis approx  500  grams. Based on suggested dosages  specified below approx. 40 \ngrams  would be required. I.e. no need to send  additional test  substance. \n\nAs mentioned  earlier, we have not firmed up the plan yet.  But I will have \nadditional  test material (~ 200 g or so) send to your facility. \n\n_____________________________________________\nSue  Tanaka\n3M Corporate Toxicology and Regulatory Services\nMail: Bldg  220-6E-03, St. Paul, MN  55144\nLab:  Bldg 270-3S-06, St. Paul, MN  55144\nTel:      651-733-9073\nFax:      651-736-2214\nE-mail: stanaka@mmm.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTOXUSA@aol.com   \n\n01/19/2007 09:01 AM \n\t\n\t\n\tTo\n\tstanaka@mmm.com  \n\tcc\n\tjlbutenhoff@mmm.com\n\tfrancois.van.otterdijk@notox.nl\n\tchris.de.ries@notox.nl  \n\tSubject\n\tFwd: 3M Revised Quote -90-day  Q.06.2022, ts 168273\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nHi  Sue \n  \nThanks for the  authorization to proceed with the 90-day  study.

Therefore, the study will need advance approval from the Animal \nExperimentation  Commission (AEC). Since the study design is still subject to \nchanges as you  indicated, we will await your further information on this \nbefore the study  is submitted to the AEC. The AEC will nontheless require a \nrationale  for conducting the study following the 28-day study which already \nused a  significant higher number of animals than the default number of \nanimals  described in the respective OPPTS guideline. Therefore, we enquired \nfor  more information as to the rationale for the study design and the request \nfor a  90-day study in general. Having this information in advance will speed \nup the  approval procedure significantly. May we therefore kindly ask you to \nprovide  this information to us?\n\nWith  regard to sending a revised draft of the 28-day study, we can inform you \nthat  the report has already been approved for finalisation on 02 January 2007 \n(please  refer to the email sent by Melinda Mitchell). On 4th January however, \nJohn  Butenhoff informed us on the deviating analytical results on test \nsubstance  formulations. We responded that it would be best to await the full \nresults and  analytical report from David Ehresman, and decide what further \nsteps should be  taken (eg correction for lower recovery, repeat analyses \netc.). John replied  that he would discuss the matter with Paul and Dave. So \nfar we have not  received a response from 3M on this topic. \n\nFurther  on the 28-day study report, a further detailed review of the raw data  \nrevealed that recovery group animals at the end of the treatment period were  \ninadvertently not anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor but with isoflurane  \ninstead. Prior to their necropsy however, both Main and Recovery group animals  \nwere anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor. I.e. the wash-out period for any  \nisoflurane metabolites may have been sufficiently long not to have adversely  \naffected the analyses on serum samples collected at the end of the recovery  \nperiod.  We do apologize for this occurrence, and will ensure that this  will \nnot happen in the 90-day study.\n\nWe look  forward to receiving any updates on the study design of the 90-day \nstudy. In the  meantime, please contact us in case of any questions.\n\nWith  best regards,\n\nFrancois\n \n\nMet vriendelijke groeten / With kind  regards,\nNOTOX  B.V.\n\nF.M. van Otterdijk, M.Sc.\nStudy Director  Toxicology\nHambakenwetering 7\nP.O.

Has the study been  initiated and approved by EPA/State  of  \nMinnesota? \n\nTo my best  knowledge, the study will be based on the following EPA guideline \non 90-day  study in rats.  I will double check to make sure this is correct.  \n\nUnited States Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA). Health Effects Test \nGuidelines, OPPTS 870-3100,  90-day oral toxicity in rodents. Office of \nPrevention, Pesticides and Toxic  Substances (7101), EPA 712-C-98-199, July \n2000. \n\nI am attaching the guideline document below for  your reference. \n\n\n\n  \nHow much  serum should be collected, and  from how many animals/group?  \n\nSimilar to our 28-day  study, blood samples from all animals (probably \nn=20/sex/group) will be  collected after last treatment so that clinical \nchemistries, hematology, and  clotting tests (like we did for the 28-day study) \ncan be determined at the end  of treatment.  Half of the rats will be \nsubsequentlhy sacrificed at the  end of treatment while the other half will be \nretained for another 21 days as  recovery. \n\nCollection from  aorta as part of necropsy  ok, or on a specific time point \nafter the last  dose on day 90?   \n\nYes, blood collection from aorta is fine at necropsy.  Let's use  the same time \nschedules that were employed in our 28-day study.  \n\nAttn to whom should these serum  samples  be sent?   \n\nSimilar to before, batches of flash-frozen livers and serum, as well as  the \ncacodylate-fixed liver tissues shall be sent to: \n\nDave Ehresman (phone:  651-733-5070, fax:   651-737-4754, e-mail: \ndjehresman@mmm.com) \n3M Company \n3M Center \n236-C148  \nSt. Paul, MN  55144  \nUSA \n\nRNA-later preserved liver samples shall be sent  to: \n\nKen Wallace (phone:   218-726-8899, fax:  218-726-8014, e-mail: \nkwallace@d.umn.edu  \nDepartement of Biochemistry&  Molecular Biology \nUniversity of  Minnesota Medical School \n1035  University Drive \nDuluth, MN  55812 \nUSA \n\nShould animals be anaesthesized with   Ketamin/Dormitor as done for the 28-day \nstudy? \n\nYes \n\nIn the 28-day study we collected liver  samples for analyses to  be conducted \nat 3M/Minnesota University. Did these  analyses reveal any  findings that may \nbe useful for the dose selection?  Apparently, in the  90-day study no \nadditional liver samples have to be   collected? \n\nSee  above, we will be interested in having the livers collected at this \npoint.    \n\nSprague Dawley rats  were used in the  28-day study. Wistar rats were mentioned \nin the  90-d quotation. Is this  correct? \n\nSprague Dawley rats should be used, not  Wistar. \n\nBased on the  28-day study results, we  suggest to use 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day as \ndosages  for the 90-day study. Dosages  in the 28-day study were 6, 30 and 150  \nmg/kg/day. At 30 mg/kg/day, males  showed notably increased liver weights  (27% \nincrease towards control animals),  along with  hyperthrophy/hyperplasia of the \nthyroid and increased cholesterol   levels.  The amount of test substance left \nis approx  500  grams. Based on suggested dosages  specified below approx. 40 \ngrams  would be required. I.e. no need to send  additional test  substance. \n\nAs mentioned  earlier, we have not firmed up the plan yet.  But I will have \nadditional  test material (~ 200 g or so) send to your facility. \n\n_____________________________________________\nSue  Tanaka\n3M Corporate Toxicology and Regulatory Services\nMail: Bldg  220-6E-03, St. Paul, MN  55144\nLab:  Bldg 270-3S-06, St. Paul, MN  55144\nTel:      651-733-9073\nFax:      651-736-2214\nE-mail: stanaka@mmm.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTOXUSA@aol.com   \n\n01/19/2007 09:01 AM \n\t\n\t\n\tTo\n\tstanaka@mmm.com  \n\tcc\n\tjlbutenhoff@mmm.com\n\tfrancois.van.otterdijk@notox.nl\n\tchris.de.ries@notox.nl  \n\tSubject\n\tFwd: 3M Revised Quote -90-day  Q.06.2022, ts 168273\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nHi  Sue \n  \nThanks for the  authorization to proceed with the 90-day  study.

Therefore, the study will need advance approval from the Animal \nExperimentation  Commission (AEC). Since the study design is still subject to \nchanges as you  indicated, we will await your further information on this \nbefore the study  is submitted to the AEC. The AEC will nontheless require a \nrationale  for conducting the study following the 28-day study which already \nused a  significant higher number of animals than the default number of \nanimals  described in the respective OPPTS guideline. Therefore, we enquired \nfor  more information as to the rationale for the study design and the request \nfor a  90-day study in general. Having this information in advance will speed \nup the  approval procedure significantly. May we therefore kindly ask you to \nprovide  this information to us?\n\nWith  regard to sending a revised draft of the 28-day study, we can inform you \nthat  the report has already been approved for finalisation on 02 January 2007 \n(please  refer to the email sent by Melinda Mitchell). On 4th January however, \nJohn  Butenhoff informed us on the deviating analytical results on test \nsubstance  formulations. We responded that it would be best to await the full \nresults and  analytical report from David Ehresman, and decide what further \nsteps should be  taken (eg correction for lower recovery, repeat analyses \netc.). John replied  that he would discuss the matter with Paul and Dave. So \nfar we have not  received a response from 3M on this topic. \n\nFurther  on the 28-day study report, a further detailed review of the raw data  \nrevealed that recovery group animals at the end of the treatment period were  \ninadvertently not anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor but with isoflurane  \ninstead. Prior to their necropsy however, both Main and Recovery group animals  \nwere anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor. I.e. the wash-out period for any  \nisoflurane metabolites may have been sufficiently long not to have adversely  \naffected the analyses on serum samples collected at the end of the recovery  \nperiod.  We do apologize for this occurrence, and will ensure that this  will \nnot happen in the 90-day study.\n\nWe look  forward to receiving any updates on the study design of the 90-day \nstudy. In the  meantime, please contact us in case of any questions.\n\nWith  best regards,\n\nFrancois\n \n\nMet vriendelijke groeten / With kind  regards,\nNOTOX  B.V.\n\nF.M. van Otterdijk, M.Sc.\nStudy Director  Toxicology\nHambakenwetering 7\nP.O.

Has the study been  initiated and approved by EPA/State  of  \nMinnesota? \n\nTo my best  knowledge, the study will be based on the following EPA guideline \non 90-day  study in rats.  I will double check to make sure this is correct.  \n\nUnited States Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA). Health Effects Test \nGuidelines, OPPTS 870-3100,  90-day oral toxicity in rodents. Office of \nPrevention, Pesticides and Toxic  Substances (7101), EPA 712-C-98-199, July \n2000. \n\nI am attaching the guideline document below for  your reference. \n\n\n\n  \nHow much  serum should be collected, and  from how many animals/group?  \n\nSimilar to our 28-day  study, blood samples from all animals (probably \nn=20/sex/group) will be  collected after last treatment so that clinical \nchemistries, hematology, and  clotting tests (like we did for the 28-day study) \ncan be determined at the end  of treatment.  Half of the rats will be \nsubsequentlhy sacrificed at the  end of treatment while the other half will be \nretained for another 21 days as  recovery. \n\nCollection from  aorta as part of necropsy  ok, or on a specific time point \nafter the last  dose on day 90?   \n\nYes, blood collection from aorta is fine at necropsy.  Let's use  the same time \nschedules that were employed in our 28-day study.  \n\nAttn to whom should these serum  samples  be sent?   \n\nSimilar to before, batches of flash-frozen livers and serum, as well as  the \ncacodylate-fixed liver tissues shall be sent to: \n\nDave Ehresman (phone:  651-733-5070, fax:   651-737-4754, e-mail: \ndjehresman@mmm.com) \n3M Company \n3M Center \n236-C148  \nSt. Paul, MN  55144  \nUSA \n\nRNA-later preserved liver samples shall be sent  to: \n\nKen Wallace (phone:   218-726-8899, fax:  218-726-8014, e-mail: \nkwallace@d.umn.edu  \nDepartement of Biochemistry&  Molecular Biology \nUniversity of  Minnesota Medical School \n1035  University Drive \nDuluth, MN  55812 \nUSA \n\nShould animals be anaesthesized with   Ketamin/Dormitor as done for the 28-day \nstudy? \n\nYes \n\nIn the 28-day study we collected liver  samples for analyses to  be conducted \nat 3M/Minnesota University. Did these  analyses reveal any  findings that may \nbe useful for the dose selection?  Apparently, in the  90-day study no \nadditional liver samples have to be   collected? \n\nSee  above, we will be interested in having the livers collected at this \npoint.    \n\nSprague Dawley rats  were used in the  28-day study. Wistar rats were mentioned \nin the  90-d quotation. Is this  correct? \n\nSprague Dawley rats should be used, not  Wistar. \n\nBased on the  28-day study results, we  suggest to use 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day as \ndosages  for the 90-day study. Dosages  in the 28-day study were 6, 30 and 150  \nmg/kg/day. At 30 mg/kg/day, males  showed notably increased liver weights  (27% \nincrease towards control animals),  along with  hyperthrophy/hyperplasia of the \nthyroid and increased cholesterol   levels.  The amount of test substance left \nis approx  500  grams. Based on suggested dosages  specified below approx. 40 \ngrams  would be required. I.e. no need to send  additional test  substance. \n\nAs mentioned  earlier, we have not firmed up the plan yet.  But I will have \nadditional  test material (~ 200 g or so) send to your facility. \n\n_____________________________________________\nSue  Tanaka\n3M Corporate Toxicology and Regulatory Services\nMail: Bldg  220-6E-03, St. Paul, MN  55144\nLab:  Bldg 270-3S-06, St. Paul, MN  55144\nTel:      651-733-9073\nFax:      651-736-2214\nE-mail: stanaka@mmm.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTOXUSA@aol.com   \n\n01/19/2007 09:01 AM \n\t\n\t\n\tTo\n\tstanaka@mmm.com  \n\tcc\n\tjlbutenhoff@mmm.com\n\tfrancois.van.otterdijk@notox.nl\n\tchris.de.ries@notox.nl  \n\tSubject\n\tFwd: 3M Revised Quote -90-day  Q.06.2022, ts 168273\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nHi  Sue \n  \nThanks for the  authorization to proceed with the 90-day  study.

Therefore, the study will need advance approval from the Animal \nExperimentation  Commission (AEC). Since the study design is still subject to \nchanges as you  indicated, we will await your further information on this \nbefore the study  is submitted to the AEC. The AEC will nontheless require a \nrationale  for conducting the study following the 28-day study which already \nused a  significant higher number of animals than the default number of \nanimals  described in the respective OPPTS guideline. Therefore, we enquired \nfor  more information as to the rationale for the study design and the request \nfor a  90-day study in general. Having this information in advance will speed \nup the  approval procedure significantly. May we therefore kindly ask you to \nprovide  this information to us?\n\nWith  regard to sending a revised draft of the 28-day study, we can inform you \nthat  the report has already been approved for finalisation on 02 January 2007 \n(please  refer to the email sent by Melinda Mitchell). On 4th January however, \nJohn  Butenhoff informed us on the deviating analytical results on test \nsubstance  formulations. We responded that it would be best to await the full \nresults and  analytical report from David Ehresman, and decide what further \nsteps should be  taken (eg correction for lower recovery, repeat analyses \netc.). John replied  that he would discuss the matter with Paul and Dave. So \nfar we have not  received a response from 3M on this topic. \n\nFurther  on the 28-day study report, a further detailed review of the raw data  \nrevealed that recovery group animals at the end of the treatment period were  \ninadvertently not anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor but with isoflurane  \ninstead. Prior to their necropsy however, both Main and Recovery group animals  \nwere anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor. I.e. the wash-out period for any  \nisoflurane metabolites may have been sufficiently long not to have adversely  \naffected the analyses on serum samples collected at the end of the recovery  \nperiod.  We do apologize for this occurrence, and will ensure that this  will \nnot happen in the 90-day study.\n\nWe look  forward to receiving any updates on the study design of the 90-day \nstudy. In the  meantime, please contact us in case of any questions.\n\nWith  best regards,\n\nFrancois\n \n\nMet vriendelijke groeten / With kind  regards,\nNOTOX  B.V.\n\nF.M. van Otterdijk, M.Sc.\nStudy Director  Toxicology\nHambakenwetering 7\nP.O.

Has the study been  initiated and approved by EPA/State  of  \nMinnesota? \n\nTo my best  knowledge, the study will be based on the following EPA guideline \non 90-day  study in rats.  I will double check to make sure this is correct.  \n\nUnited States Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA). Health Effects Test \nGuidelines, OPPTS 870-3100,  90-day oral toxicity in rodents. Office of \nPrevention, Pesticides and Toxic  Substances (7101), EPA 712-C-98-199, July \n2000. \n\nI am attaching the guideline document below for  your reference. \n\n\n\n  \nHow much  serum should be collected, and  from how many animals/group?  \n\nSimilar to our 28-day  study, blood samples from all animals (probably \nn=20/sex/group) will be  collected after last treatment so that clinical \nchemistries, hematology, and  clotting tests (like we did for the 28-day study) \ncan be determined at the end  of treatment.  Half of the rats will be \nsubsequentlhy sacrificed at the  end of treatment while the other half will be \nretained for another 21 days as  recovery. \n\nCollection from  aorta as part of necropsy  ok, or on a specific time point \nafter the last  dose on day 90?   \n\nYes, blood collection from aorta is fine at necropsy.  Let's use  the same time \nschedules that were employed in our 28-day study.  \n\nAttn to whom should these serum  samples  be sent?   \n\nSimilar to before, batches of flash-frozen livers and serum, as well as  the \ncacodylate-fixed liver tissues shall be sent to: \n\nDave Ehresman (phone:  651-733-5070, fax:   651-737-4754, e-mail: \ndjehresman@mmm.com) \n3M Company \n3M Center \n236-C148  \nSt. Paul, MN  55144  \nUSA \n\nRNA-later preserved liver samples shall be sent  to: \n\nKen Wallace (phone:   218-726-8899, fax:  218-726-8014, e-mail: \nkwallace@d.umn.edu  \nDepartement of Biochemistry&  Molecular Biology \nUniversity of  Minnesota Medical School \n1035  University Drive \nDuluth, MN  55812 \nUSA \n\nShould animals be anaesthesized with   Ketamin/Dormitor as done for the 28-day \nstudy? \n\nYes \n\nIn the 28-day study we collected liver  samples for analyses to  be conducted \nat 3M/Minnesota University. Did these  analyses reveal any  findings that may \nbe useful for the dose selection?  Apparently, in the  90-day study no \nadditional liver samples have to be   collected? \n\nSee  above, we will be interested in having the livers collected at this \npoint.    \n\nSprague Dawley rats  were used in the  28-day study. Wistar rats were mentioned \nin the  90-d quotation. Is this  correct? \n\nSprague Dawley rats should be used, not  Wistar. \n\nBased on the  28-day study results, we  suggest to use 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day as \ndosages  for the 90-day study. Dosages  in the 28-day study were 6, 30 and 150  \nmg/kg/day. At 30 mg/kg/day, males  showed notably increased liver weights  (27% \nincrease towards control animals),  along with  hyperthrophy/hyperplasia of the \nthyroid and increased cholesterol   levels.  The amount of test substance left \nis approx  500  grams. Based on suggested dosages  specified below approx. 40 \ngrams  would be required. I.e. no need to send  additional test  substance. \n\nAs mentioned  earlier, we have not firmed up the plan yet.  But I will have \nadditional  test material (~ 200 g or so) send to your facility. \n\n_____________________________________________\nSue  Tanaka\n3M Corporate Toxicology and Regulatory Services\nMail: Bldg  220-6E-03, St. Paul, MN  55144\nLab:  Bldg 270-3S-06, St. Paul, MN  55144\nTel:      651-733-9073\nFax:      651-736-2214\nE-mail: stanaka@mmm.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTOXUSA@aol.com   \n\n01/19/2007 09:01 AM \n\t\n\t\n\tTo\n\tstanaka@mmm.com  \n\tcc\n\tjlbutenhoff@mmm.com\n\tfrancois.van.otterdijk@notox.nl\n\tchris.de.ries@notox.nl  \n\tSubject\n\tFwd: 3M Revised Quote -90-day  Q.06.2022, ts 168273\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nHi  Sue \n  \nThanks for the  authorization to proceed with the 90-day  study.
