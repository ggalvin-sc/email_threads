Re: Fwd: 3M Revised Quote -90-day Q.06.2022, ts 168273
Body:
Dear Francois,

I apologize for this (very much) delayed reply.  Things got quite busy in the 
last two weeks and I apologize in advance if this may have caused any 
inconvenience.

With regards to your questions, please see the replies below the questions (in 
bold text).  We have not firmed up our study plan details and there is a 
possibility that we might also add a couple of satellite groups for interim 
blood collection purpose.  Several meetings are being planned before now and 
early next week, by which I am hoping to provide you with much more details as 
they become available.

On a separate but related note, can you tell us when the revised draft report 
for the 28-day study might become available?  

Please let me know if there is any question.  As always, thanks for your kind 
help in this.

Regards,

Sue

================================================================================
===================

The study will have to be submitted to the  Animal Experimentation Commission. 
For approval, they need an extensive  rationale as to why this follow-up study 
is required. Has the study been  initiated and approved by EPA/State  of 
Minnesota?

To my best knowledge, the study will be based on the following EPA guideline on 
90-day study in rats.  I will double check to make sure this is correct.

United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Health Effects Test 
Guidelines, OPPTS 870-3100, 90-day oral toxicity in rodents. Office of 
Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances (7101), EPA 712-C-98-199, July 2000.

I am attaching the guideline document below for your reference.



 
How much serum should be collected, and  from how many animals/group? 

Similar to our 28-day study, blood samples from all animals (probably 
n=20/sex/group) will be collected after last treatment so that clinical 
chemistries, hematology, and clotting tests (like we did for the 28-day study) 
can be determined at the end of treatment.  Half of the rats will be 
subsequentlhy sacrificed at the end of treatment while the other half will be 
retained for another 21 days as recovery. 

Collection from aorta as part of necropsy  ok, or on a specific time point 
after the last dose on day 90?  

Yes, blood collection from aorta is fine at necropsy.  Let's use the same time 
schedules that were employed in our 28-day study.

Attn to whom should these serum samples  be sent?  

Similar to before, batches of flash-frozen livers and serum, as well as the 
cacodylate-fixed liver tissues shall be sent to:

Dave Ehresman (phone:  651-733-5070, fax:  651-737-4754, e-mail: 
djehresman@mmm.com)
3M Company
3M Center
236-C148
St. Paul, MN  55144 
USA 

RNA-later preserved liver samples shall be sent to:

Ken Wallace (phone:  218-726-8899, fax:  218-726-8014, e-mail: 
kwallace@d.umn.edu
Departement of Biochemistry& Molecular Biology
University of Minnesota Medical School
1035 University Drive
Duluth, MN 55812
USA

Should animals be anaesthesized with  Ketamin/Dormitor as done for the 28-day 
study?

Yes

In the 28-day study we collected liver  samples for analyses to be conducted at 
3M/Minnesota University. Did these  analyses reveal any findings that may be 
useful for the dose selection?  Apparently, in the 90-day study no additional 
liver samples have to be  collected?

See above, we will be interested in having the livers collected at this point.  

Sprague Dawley rats were used in the  28-day study. Wistar rats were mentioned 
in the 90-d quotation. Is this  correct?

Sprague Dawley rats should be used, not Wistar.

Based on the 28-day study results, we  suggest to use 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day as 
dosages for the 90-day study. Dosages  in the 28-day study were 6, 30 and 150 
mg/kg/day. At 30 mg/kg/day, males  showed notably increased liver weights (27% 
increase towards control animals),  along with hyperthrophy/hyperplasia of the 
thyroid and increased cholesterol  levels.  The amount of test substance left 
is approx  500 grams. Based on suggested dosages  specified below approx. 40 
grams would be required. I.e. no need to send  additional test substance.

As mentioned earlier, we have not firmed up the plan yet.  But I will have 
additional test material (~ 200 g or so) send to your facility.

Hi Sue
 
Thanks for the authorization to proceed with the 90-day  study. Francois van 
Otterdijk will be your study director. He also was  responsible for the 28-day 
study. He has asked several questions regarding the  study. Can you please 
review and advise. Thanks very much in  advance.
 
With best regards
NOTOX (USA)

Dear Robert,
 
The amount of test substance left is approx  500 grams. Based on suggested 
dosages  specified below approx. 40 grams would be required. I.e. no need to 
send  additional test substance.
 
I have not yet received a planning, but I am  sure they are eagerly working on 
it!
 
Some additional questions on the referred quotation you may be able to  answer 
and/or may have to forward to Sue Tanaka:

Finalized study with John Butenhoff today. Draft of revised quote  attached. 
Need to price with 3 week recovery group. Base price w/o RF 87,950  euro so we 
just need to add cost of recovery to this. No TK just serum at  termination to 
be returned to 3M for analysis. Test article is ammonium PFBA  (168273) for 
which OTF completed 28-day study so no RF study required. Also  need to know 
how much sample we have left and how much we will need for 90 by  oral gavage. 
Timing is again critical. We gave him a start of 8-10 weeks from  when 
everything was in-house. Is this still feasible? Can we start faster?  Please 
review and advise. He is eager to sign and get project underway.
 
Thanks and regards
Robert
