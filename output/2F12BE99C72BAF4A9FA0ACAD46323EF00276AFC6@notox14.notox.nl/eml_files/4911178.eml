Hi Sue

Thanks for the authorization to proceed with the 90-day study. Francois van Otterdijk will be your study director.
He also was responsible for the 28-day study. He has asked several questions regarding the study. Can you
please review and advise. Thanks very much in advance.

With best regards
NOTOX (USA)

The study will have to be submitted to the Animal Experimentation Commission. For approval, they need an extensive rationale as to
why this follow-up study is required. Has the study been initiated and approved by EPA/State of Minnesota?

Collection of serum:
How much serum should be collected, and from how many animals/group?
Collection from aorta as part of necropsy ok, or on a specific time point after the last dose on day 90?
Attn to whom should these serum samples be sent?
Other questions:
Should animals be anaesthesized with Ketamin/Dormitor as done for the 28-day study?
In the 28-day study we collected liver samples for analyses to be conducted at 3M/Minnesota University. Did these analyses reveal
any findings that may be useful for the dose selection? Apparently, in the 90-day study no additional liver samples have to be
 collected?
Sprague Dawley rats were used in the 28-day study. Wistar rats were mentioned in the 90-d quotation. Is this correct?
Based on the 28-day study results, we suggest to use 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day as dosages for the 90-day study. Dosages in the 28-day study
were 6, 30 and 150 mg/kg/day. At 30 mg/kg/day, males showed notably increased liver weights (27% increase towards control animals),
 along with hyperthrophy/hyperplasia of the thyroid and increased cholesterol levels. 
The amount of test substance left is approx 500 grams. Based on suggested dosages specified below approx. 40 grams would be
required. I.e. no need to send additional test substance.

Dear Robert,

The amount of test substance left is approx 500 grams. Based on suggested dosages specified below approx. 40
grams would be required. I.e. no need to send additional test substance.

I have not yet received a planning, but I am sure they are eagerly working on it!

Some additional questions on the referred quotation you may be able to answer and/or may have to forward to
Sue Tanaka:

Chris

Finalized study with John Butenhoff today. Draft of revised quote attached. Need to price with 3 week recovery group. Base price w/o
RF 87,950 euro so we just need to add cost of recovery to this. No TK just serum at termination to be returned to 3M for analysis. Test
article is ammonium PFBA (168273) for which OTF completed 28-day study so no RF study required. Also need to know how much
sample we have left and how much we will need for 90 by oral gavage. Timing is again critical. We gave him a start of 8-10 weeks from
 when everything was in-house. Is this still feasible? Can we start faster? Please review and advise. He is eager to sign and get project
underway.

Thanks and regards
Robert
