RE: Fwd: 3M Revised Quote -90-day Q.06.2022, ts 168273
Body:
Dear  Sue,

Thank  you for your reply on our questions on the upcoming 90-day study.  
Please let us explain some of the points addressed in your  email.

The  study design for this study will deviate from the standard design 
described in  the OPPTS guideline which we routinely use for EPA study 
requirements.  Therefore, the study will need advance approval from the Animal 
Experimentation  Commission (AEC). Since the study design is still subject to 
changes as you  indicated, we will await your further information on this 
before the study  is submitted to the AEC. The AEC will nontheless require a 
rationale  for conducting the study following the 28-day study which already 
used a  significant higher number of animals than the default number of 
animals  described in the respective OPPTS guideline. Therefore, we enquired 
for  more information as to the rationale for the study design and the request 
for a  90-day study in general. Having this information in advance will speed 
up the  approval procedure significantly. May we therefore kindly ask you to 
provide  this information to us?

With  regard to sending a revised draft of the 28-day study, we can inform you 
that  the report has already been approved for finalisation on 02 January 2007 
(please  refer to the email sent by Melinda Mitchell). On 4th January however, 
John  Butenhoff informed us on the deviating analytical results on test 
substance  formulations. We responded that it would be best to await the full 
results and  analytical report from David Ehresman, and decide what further 
steps should be  taken (eg correction for lower recovery, repeat analyses 
etc.). John replied  that he would discuss the matter with Paul and Dave. So 
far we have not  received a response from 3M on this topic. 

Further  on the 28-day study report, a further detailed review of the raw data  
revealed that recovery group animals at the end of the treatment period were  
inadvertently not anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor but with isoflurane  
instead. Prior to their necropsy however, both Main and Recovery group animals  
were anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor. I.e. the wash-out period for any  
isoflurane metabolites may have been sufficiently long not to have adversely  
affected the analyses on serum samples collected at the end of the recovery  
period.  We do apologize for this occurrence, and will ensure that this  will 
not happen in the 90-day study.

We look  forward to receiving any updates on the study design of the 90-day 
study. In the  meantime, please contact us in case of any questions.

With  best regards,

Francois

Dear Francois, 

I apologize  for this (very much) delayed reply.  Things got quite busy in the 
last  two weeks and I apologize in advance if this may have caused any  
inconvenience. 

With regards to  your questions, please see the replies below the questions (in 
bold text).   We have not firmed up our study plan details and there is a 
possibility  that we might also add a couple of satellite groups for interim 
blood  collection purpose.  Several meetings are being planned before now and  
early next week, by which I am hoping to provide you with much more details as  
they become available. 

On a  separate but related note, can you tell us when the revised draft report 
for  the 28-day study might become available?   

Please let me know if there is any question.  As  always, thanks for your kind 
help in this. 

Regards, 

Sue 

================================================================================
===================  

The study will have to be  submitted to the  Animal Experimentation Commission. 
For approval, they  need an extensive  rationale as to why this follow-up study 
is required.  Has the study been  initiated and approved by EPA/State  of  
Minnesota? 

To my best  knowledge, the study will be based on the following EPA guideline 
on 90-day  study in rats.  I will double check to make sure this is correct.  

United States Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA). Health Effects Test 
Guidelines, OPPTS 870-3100,  90-day oral toxicity in rodents. Office of 
Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic  Substances (7101), EPA 712-C-98-199, July 
2000. 

I am attaching the guideline document below for  your reference. 



  
How much  serum should be collected, and  from how many animals/group?  

Similar to our 28-day  study, blood samples from all animals (probably 
n=20/sex/group) will be  collected after last treatment so that clinical 
chemistries, hematology, and  clotting tests (like we did for the 28-day study) 
can be determined at the end  of treatment.  Half of the rats will be 
subsequentlhy sacrificed at the  end of treatment while the other half will be 
retained for another 21 days as  recovery. 

Collection from  aorta as part of necropsy  ok, or on a specific time point 
after the last  dose on day 90?   

Yes, blood collection from aorta is fine at necropsy.  Let's use  the same time 
schedules that were employed in our 28-day study.  

Attn to whom should these serum  samples  be sent?   

Similar to before, batches of flash-frozen livers and serum, as well as  the 
cacodylate-fixed liver tissues shall be sent to: 

Dave Ehresman (phone:  651-733-5070, fax:   651-737-4754, e-mail: 
djehresman@mmm.com) 
3M Company 
3M Center 
236-C148  
St. Paul, MN  55144  
USA 

RNA-later preserved liver samples shall be sent  to: 

Ken Wallace (phone:   218-726-8899, fax:  218-726-8014, e-mail: 
kwallace@d.umn.edu  
Departement of Biochemistry&  Molecular Biology 
University of  Minnesota Medical School 
1035  University Drive 
Duluth, MN  55812 
USA 

Should animals be anaesthesized with   Ketamin/Dormitor as done for the 28-day 
study? 

Yes 

In the 28-day study we collected liver  samples for analyses to  be conducted 
at 3M/Minnesota University. Did these  analyses reveal any  findings that may 
be useful for the dose selection?  Apparently, in the  90-day study no 
additional liver samples have to be   collected? 

See  above, we will be interested in having the livers collected at this 
point.    

Sprague Dawley rats  were used in the  28-day study. Wistar rats were mentioned 
in the  90-d quotation. Is this  correct? 

Sprague Dawley rats should be used, not  Wistar. 

Based on the  28-day study results, we  suggest to use 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day as 
dosages  for the 90-day study. Dosages  in the 28-day study were 6, 30 and 150  
mg/kg/day. At 30 mg/kg/day, males  showed notably increased liver weights  (27% 
increase towards control animals),  along with  hyperthrophy/hyperplasia of the 
thyroid and increased cholesterol   levels.  The amount of test substance left 
is approx  500  grams. Based on suggested dosages  specified below approx. 40 
grams  would be required. I.e. no need to send  additional test  substance. 

As mentioned  earlier, we have not firmed up the plan yet.  But I will have 
additional  test material (~ 200 g or so) send to your facility.

Hi  Sue 
  
Thanks for the  authorization to proceed with the 90-day  study. Francois van 
Otterdijk  will be your study director. He also was  responsible for the 
28-day  study. He has asked several questions regarding the  study. Can you  
please review and advise. Thanks very much in  advance. 
  
With best regards

Dear Robert, 
   
The amount of test substance left is approx  500 grams.  Based on suggested 
dosages  specified below approx. 40 grams would  be required. I.e. no need to 
send  additional test substance.  
  
I have not yet received a  planning, but I am  sure they are eagerly working on 
it! 
  
Some additional questions on the  referred quotation you may be able to  answer 
and/or may have to forward  to Sue Tanaka: 
  
The  study will have to be submitted  to the Animal Experimentation  
Commission. For approval, they need an extensive  rationale as to why  this

Chris 
  
Finalized  study with John Butenhoff today. Draft of revised quote  attached. 
Need  to price with 3 week recovery group. Base price w/o RF 87,950  euro so 
we  just need to add cost of recovery to this. No TK just serum at  
 termination to be returned to 3M for analysis. Test article is ammonium  PFBA 
 (168273) for which OTF completed 28-day study so no RF study  required. Also 
 need to know how much sample we have left and how much we  will need for 90 by 
 oral gavage. Timing is again critical. We gave him a  start of 8-10 weeks from 
 when everything was in-house. Is this still  feasible? Can we start faster? 
 Please review and advise. He is eager to  sign and get project underway. 
  
Thanks and regards 
Robert
