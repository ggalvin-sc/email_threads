Dear Bill,

...sorry but it took my research services offices exactly 5 days 
minus 15 minutes to get back to me with a draft agreement. it is 
attached.  I've put in draft dates etc.  I've also updated the 
proposal a wee bit given progress and some new ideas we have on 
temporal monitoring.

thoughts?

the contact for now in research services is Homer Henry: 
homer.henry@utoronto.ca

I'm ccing chemistry's own grants officer (Judy Hon) on this email and 
you can liase with her as well and particularly to help shepherd this 
through the process.

warm regards,
Scott
