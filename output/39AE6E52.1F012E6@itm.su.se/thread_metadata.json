Have you got any publications or reports from\nthat work?\n\nHave you also been looking for other compounds? Both perfluoroheptane\nand tridecafluoroiodohexane have been identified as compounds of very\nhigh concern in the OSPAR work with hazardous substances. We also\nuderstand that a large number of other perflourinated substances are\nbeing produced and marketed for different applications.\n\nAny information you can give us would be very much appreciated.\n\nBest regards,\nBo Jansson\n\n--\nProfessor Bo Jansson\nInstitute of Applied Environmental Research\nStockholm University, SE-106 91 Stockholm\nTel: +46-8674 7220  Fax: +46-8758 1360\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Principal>  CN=Dale L.

What I would ask you Tuesday is whether there\nis any time next week when I could come out to talk to you.  Esquire would\nlike a story of some length on the subject and since you are at the heart of\nit, it would be better for us to talk in person than on the phone.  If you\nhad time to meet, I would be very grateful.  I could fit into your schedule\nin whatever way necessary.  There is no reason to stop what you might be\ndoing to sit down and talk.  The best way to have these discussions is\ninformally---in a car on your way to an appointment, in a hallway, at\nlunch---in whatever fashion suits you.  In the course of several hours,\nduring which I might sometimes read something on the subject or otherwise\noccupy myself while you're at a meeting, or in some other manner engaged.\n     I think it's a wonderful story, and I was excited when Esquire called\nme, and I hope it will work out.  They would like the story sooner rather\nthan later, which is why I am under a little bit of pressure from having a\ndeadline.\n     In case you would like to know anything about me, I have been a writer\nat The New Yorker since 1980, but I also work for Esquire and a few other\nmagazines when I can.  I've been a Guggenheim Fellow and have published five\nbooks and have won a couple of literary prizes.\n     Thanks. \nYours,\nAlec Wilkinson \n \n ",
