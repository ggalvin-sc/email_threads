Dear Dr. Giesy,

We represent a couple of labs in Europe discussing the possibilities to
look for fluorinated compounds in the environment.We have got some of
the 3M documents on PFOS and understand you have been involved in the
analysis of this compound. Have you got any publications or reports from
that work?

Have you also been looking for other compounds? Both perfluoroheptane
and tridecafluoroiodohexane have been identified as compounds of very
high concern in the OSPAR work with hazardous substances. We also
uderstand that a large number of other perflourinated substances are
being produced and marketed for different applications.

Any information you can give us would be very much appreciated.

Best regards,
Bo Jansson
