Dear Dr. Giesy, 
     Thank you for the number.  What I would ask you Tuesday is whether there
is any time next week when I could come out to talk to you.  Esquire would
like a story of some length on the subject and since you are at the heart of
it, it would be better for us to talk in person than on the phone.  If you
had time to meet, I would be very grateful.  I could fit into your schedule
in whatever way necessary.  There is no reason to stop what you might be
doing to sit down and talk.  The best way to have these discussions is
informally---in a car on your way to an appointment, in a hallway, at
lunch---in whatever fashion suits you.  In the course of several hours,
during which I might sometimes read something on the subject or otherwise
occupy myself while you're at a meeting, or in some other manner engaged.
     I think it's a wonderful story, and I was excited when Esquire called
me, and I hope it will work out.  They would like the story sooner rather
than later, which is why I am under a little bit of pressure from having a
deadline.
     In case you would like to know anything about me, I have been a writer
at The New Yorker since 1980, but I also work for Esquire and a few other
magazines when I can.  I've been a Guggenheim Fellow and have published five
books and have won a couple of literary prizes.
     Thanks. 
Yours,
Alec Wilkinson
