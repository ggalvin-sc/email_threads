 I received this request from a physician.

 Dear Dr. Giesy,                                                                                     
 I am an internist in Birmingham, and am interested in measuring a subgroup of                       
 patients for PFOS. I can order PFOA, but not PFOS from a commercial lab. I saw your                 
 name mentioned in an article on PFOS (Env Science & Techn) , and wonder if you can                  
 you run these PFOS assays for me, on a fee basis?                                                   
 Is finding PFOA roughly eguivalent to finding PFOS, and are the levels parallel?                    
 Thanks
