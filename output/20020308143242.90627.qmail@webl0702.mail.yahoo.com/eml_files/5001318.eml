Dear Mike and Dale: 
I received this request from a physician.  I also got another request from a
physician who wants to have hundreds of samples measured for PFOS for
$500/sample.  I have told both of them that we are not in a position to
assist them.  From what I can gather a number of attorneys around the country
are contemplating class action suits, but I am not certain that this is the
interest in these most recent cases.  Since we do not do human blood in our
studies, I declined to discuss the issue in detail with these individuals.
Please let me know if you have additional information or wan to discuss this
information in more detail.

Dear Dr. Giesy,
I am an internist in Birmingham, and am interested in measuring a subgroup of patients for PFOS.  I can order PFOA, but not PFOS from a commercial lab. I saw your name mentioned in an article on PFOS (Env Science & Techn) , and wonder if you can you run these PFOS assays for me, on a fee basis?
Is finding PFOA roughly equivalent to finding PFOS, and are the levels parallel?
Thanks
