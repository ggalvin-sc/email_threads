Body:
Joe,

Larry is in Europe this week.  I will discuss with him upon his return.  Larry 
provided me your cost estimate for the cancer case cohrot studies but I don't 
have anything for the Danish birth cohort analyses (at least I don't think 
so).  Have you sent this to Larry?

Geary

larry and geary,  below is a communication from jorn olsen regarding the 
potential mother-offspring study. he and iei have been negotiating for months 
and working on a written proposal for the last week or so. currently he holds 
the epi chair at ucla but is still the principal investigator of the danish 
national birth cohort, among other things (e.g., he's president of the IEA).  
the governmental approvals are quite time consuming for this particular cohort 
and he would like to know when he could expect to know whether he will be 
funded, as he believes it is more efficient and more promising to cinch the ok 
if these approval bodies are approached  with funding in hand. obviously, i am 
not asking for any commitment on your part but just an estimate as to when you 
might reach a decision on this proposed component of the pfos/pfoa research, 
assuming i can get a draft proposal to you in the next week or so.  thanks.  joe

Joe what is the expected time schedule?

 

 

We have sent the application to the Steering committee and will probably know 
more in 2-3 weeks but I guess they will say yes.

 

The next steps are time consuming and I would want to have funding in place 
before we contact the IRB, Data Inspectorate etc.

 

Jorn

Hi!

Here's the document with the budget updated.  In the meantime I need to put 
the UCLA portion through process.  I'll need to know the name and mailing 
address for who to send it to in Denmark.

Thanks!
Kathy
