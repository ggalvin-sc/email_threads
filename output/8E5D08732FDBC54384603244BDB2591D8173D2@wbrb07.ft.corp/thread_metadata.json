Of course you know better what really happened, and I  \nhave to excuse, if I have overestimated your role in the PFOS history.  \nHowever, as I see it, your reseach work and other efforts were a main  \nbasis for the decision by 3M at that early time. Of course, your coworkers  and \ncollaborators also have played an important role but some exceptional  \nindividual leaders are always needed as drivers and communicators.\n \nI had planned to go to Toronto, and it may  still happen. However, I have a new \nproject for the DEPA on household products  and indoor climate (PFAS \nincluded!), which start is delayed but still has to be  finished in November. \nBefore September the first part should be finished, so may  be I have to be \nhome and work late August.\n \nTwo weeks ago I had a lecture about the PFOS  DEPA report at the annual meeting \nof the Danish Health Ministry Centre for  Environmental medicine. I was \nsurprised how little people knew about these  chemicals. Some researchers, who \nhave a  large epidemiological human blood bank with samples back to the  70s \nand 80s, were interested in measuring the perfluorinated chemicals also.  Thus \nmay be we will make a project in Denmark studying trends.  Those blood samples \nare supposed to be tested for sex hormones  also.\n \nYours truly,\n \nAllan\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: JGiesy@aol.com  [mailto:JGiesy@aol.com]\nSent: 7. juni 2005 00:38\nTo: Allan  Astrup Jensen\nSubject: report\n\n\n\nAlan:\n \nThank you for the copy of the report.  I read it over the  weekend.  \n \nI noticed that you mention that I was largely responsible for PFOS  production \nbeing ceased in 2000.  While it is true that we were working  hard and \npublished the first results on concentrations in the environment and  \nparticularly in wildlife, it is important to note that we were doing all of  \nthis in close cooperation with the 3M company.  The withdrawal of the  product \nwas voluntary and based on an agreement with the US EPA.   Furthermore, the \ndecision was based on the results of our work as well as  that of many other \nscientists within and outside of 3M who were doing the  toxicity studies.  In \nthe end it was a business decision, based on a many  factors, including the fat \nthat there seemed to be replacement products that  had a better environmental \nprofile.  While I was part of the team, I was  hardly even the key part of the \nteam that made this decision.  It is  important to me that due credit be given \nto those who deserve it so I hope  that you will take the opportunity to dispel \nany misperception and give due  credit to my colleagues at both the 3M company \nand US EPA without whom I could  not have done any of the work we were able to \nassist with.  In this case,  it was the leadership of 3M that undertook this \ndecision, without any external  pressure or coercion from me or anyone else.  I \nam just a scientist and  do not have that much influence on such decisions.  I \njust try to provide  the best possible factual information so that appropriate \ndecisions can be  reached by those who have the responsibility to make such \ndecisions.  I  think it was taken because 3M has always thought of themselves \nas a very  \"green\" company.  They were really surprised when they found PFOS \nto  be widespread in the environment. I agree with the decision, but was not  \nso much responsible for it.  I think it was taken as a proactive step  even \nbefore we had the toxicological information to assess the potential for  \neffects.  Now that we have that information, we realize that while it was  \nunlikely that PFOS ever reached a concentration that would have resulted in  \nadverse effects in wildlife, it was a prudent decision because additional  \nproduction might have resulted in concentrations in the future that would have  \napproached the threshold for effects in some species.  \n \nWill you be at the Fluoros and Dioxin meetings in Toronto?  I hope  to see you \nthere.\n \n \nSincerely,\n\nJohn P.
