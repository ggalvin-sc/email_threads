Dear John,
 
Thank you for your mail. Of course you know better what really happened, and I  
have to excuse, if I have overestimated your role in the PFOS history.  
However, as I see it, your reseach work and other efforts were a main  
basis for the decision by 3M at that early time. Of course, your coworkers  and 
collaborators also have played an important role but some exceptional  
individual leaders are always needed as drivers and communicators.
 
I had planned to go to Toronto, and it may  still happen. However, I have a new 
project for the DEPA on household products  and indoor climate (PFAS 
included!), which start is delayed but still has to be  finished in November. 
Before September the first part should be finished, so may  be I have to be 
home and work late August.
 
Two weeks ago I had a lecture about the PFOS  DEPA report at the annual meeting 
of the Danish Health Ministry Centre for  Environmental medicine. I was 
surprised how little people knew about these  chemicals. Some researchers, who 
have a  large epidemiological human blood bank with samples back to the  70s 
and 80s, were interested in measuring the perfluorinated chemicals also.  Thus 
may be we will make a project in Denmark studying trends.  Those blood samples 
are supposed to be tested for sex hormones  also.
 
Yours truly,
 
Allan

Alan:
 
Thank you for the copy of the report.  I read it over the  weekend.  
 
I noticed that you mention that I was largely responsible for PFOS  production 
being ceased in 2000.  While it is true that we were working  hard and 
published the first results on concentrations in the environment and  
particularly in wildlife, it is important to note that we were doing all of  
this in close cooperation with the 3M company.  The withdrawal of the  product 
was voluntary and based on an agreement with the US EPA.   Furthermore, the 
decision was based on the results of our work as well as  that of many other 
scientists within and outside of 3M who were doing the  toxicity studies.  In 
the end it was a business decision, based on a many  factors, including the fat 
that there seemed to be replacement products that  had a better environmental 
profile.  While I was part of the team, I was  hardly even the key part of the 
team that made this decision.  It is  important to me that due credit be given 
to those who deserve it so I hope  that you will take the opportunity to dispel 
any misperception and give due  credit to my colleagues at both the 3M company 
and US EPA without whom I could  not have done any of the work we were able to 
assist with.  In this case,  it was the leadership of 3M that undertook this 
decision, without any external  pressure or coercion from me or anyone else.  I 
am just a scientist and  do not have that much influence on such decisions.  I 
just try to provide  the best possible factual information so that appropriate 
decisions can be  reached by those who have the responsibility to make such 
decisions.  I  think it was taken because 3M has always thought of themselves 
as a very  "green" company.  They were really surprised when they found PFOS 
to  be widespread in the environment. I agree with the decision, but was not  
so much responsible for it.  I think it was taken as a proactive step  even 
before we had the toxicological information to assess the potential for  
effects.  Now that we have that information, we realize that while it was  
unlikely that PFOS ever reached a concentration that would have resulted in  
adverse effects in wildlife, it was a prudent decision because additional  
production might have resulted in concentrations in the future that would have  
approached the threshold for effects in some species.  
 
Will you be at the Fluoros and Dioxin meetings in Toronto?  I hope  to see you 
there.
 
 
Sincerely,
