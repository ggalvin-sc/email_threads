Thank you for the copy of the report.  I read it over the  weekend.  
 
I noticed that you mention that I was largely responsible for PFOS  production 
being ceased in 2000.  While it is true that we were working  hard and 
published the first results on concentrations in the environment and  
particularly in wildlife, it is important to note that we were doing all of 
this  in close cooperation with the 3M company.  The withdrawal of the product  
was voluntary and based on an agreement with the US EPA.   Furthermore, the 
decision was based on the results of our work as well as  that of many other 
scientists within and outside of 3M who were doing the  toxicity studies.  In 
the end it was a business decision, based on a many  factors, including the fat 
that there seemed to be replacement products that had  a better environmental 
profile.  While I was part of the team, I was  hardly even the key part of the 
team that made this decision.  It is  important to me that due credit be given 
to those who deserve it so I hope that  you will take the opportunity to dispel 
any misperception and give due credit to  my colleagues at both the 3M company 
and US EPA without whom I could not have  done any of the work we were able to 
assist with.  In this case, it was the  leadership of 3M that undertook this 
decision, without any external pressure or  coercion from me or anyone else.  I 
am just a scientist and do not have  that much influence on such decisions.  I 
just try to provide the best  possible factual information so that appropriate 
decisions can be reached by  those who have the responsibility to make such 
decisions.  I think it was  taken because 3M has always thought of themselves 
as a very "green"  company.  They were really surprised when they found PFOS to 
be  widespread in the environment. I agree with the decision, but was not so  
much responsible for it.  I think it was taken as a proactive step even  before 
we had the toxicological information to assess the potential for  effects.  Now 
that we have that information, we realize that while it was  unlikely that PFOS 
ever reached a concentration that would have resulted in  adverse effects in 
wildlife, it was a prudent decision because additional  production might have 
resulted in concentrations in the future that would have  approached the 
threshold for effects in some species.  
 
Will you be at the Fluoros and Dioxin meetings in Toronto?  I hope to  see you 
there.
 
 
Sincerely,
