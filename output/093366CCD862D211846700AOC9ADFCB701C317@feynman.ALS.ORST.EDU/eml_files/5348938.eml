Jo,

Attached is the manuscript from Jennifer Field's graduate student on 
fluorochemicals at firefighting sites.  I will read through it and send it 
again if I have any comments.  As I noted in my phone message, Don Hagen has 
also forwarded copies to Dave Sanders and Bill Weppner.

Regards

Eric

Dear Mr. Hagen,

It has been awhile since we have spoken regarding our perfluorinated
surfactant research project here at Oregon State University.

Our manuscript, Determination of Perfluorinated Carboxylic Acids in
Groundwater Impacted by Fire Training Activity, is near completion and we
intend to submit it to Environmental Science and Technology.

I have attached a copy of the manuscript. (If the attached file is
unretrievable/unreadable please let me know and I will forward a hardcopy to
you.)
We would appreciate your comments regarding the paper, preferably within a
two week time period, thus allowing us time to consider and/or incorporate
your comments.

Please note that laboratory work is still in progress to complete Table 3.
Replicate samples are being analyzed to increase the number of samples
analyzed and allow for a more rigorous statistical evaluation of the data.

Additionally (on a separate note), we would like to locate a laboratory that
will perform total organofluorine analysis in water samples using the
oxyhydrogen torch method.  We realize this is a specialized type of analysis
such that the number of laboratories having this capability is small.  Any
help locating such a service would be most appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your time and commentary.  Please feel free to
contact me at (541)737-5431 or Jennifer at (541)737-2267 if you have any
questions regarding the manuscript or if you would like to further discuss
its content.

Enjoy the Thanksgiving holiday!

Sincerely,

Cheryl
