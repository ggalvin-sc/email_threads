Body:
Bill:
I have been in touch with Dr. John Giesy as he contacted me last week asking me 
to provide some material/writeup for the method validation paper.  Based on our 
recent correspondences, I think we lost our original intent/goal of the study.  
I thought that we working working developing a more refined method by comparing 
3 extractionmethods and 3 quantitation methods with 3 types of blood matrices. 
However,  John is talking a lot about retracking my paper in ES&T published in 
2004 on blood analysis from several countries.  I have no base why that paper 
needs to be retracted.  To me it appears that it is not going anywhere and my 
student is too busy working on her thesis project.  We cannot continue working 
for nothing.  I have sent the following mail to John.  I will forward a few 
other mails that we communicated to keep you in loop.

John:
Lin and I have spent more time on this project, desptite no funds from any 
source, to help you and Bill and 3M as a whole.  But we do not seem to go 
anywhere with this project and it does not seem to benefit us in any way.  
Unfortunetely, this is not a part of Lin's thesis work and she is reluctant to 
keep working on this for nothing. I do not understand how you come up with a 
bias of 1000% without having our results for those individual samples.  I do 
not beleive this.  Our values match exactly with what Bill Reagen had produced 
and it is confirmed again by several earlier studies and I do not want to waste 
my time working on this.  Because it takes too much of our time, I have to give 
up on this although we had spent quite a lot of time.

Kannan:
 
My focus is on the validated method, but I have been reviewing the results in 
great detail and was just trying to help.  I understand your position.  I 
disagree, but understand you position.  I have looked at what you did and then 
tried to do the same thin in my own lab and find about a 1000%-fold bias using 
the methods that you indicated that you used in that paper.  The biggest issues 
are for PFOA.  For PFBS there are to biases that would cancel each other out.  
If you use internal standards you can remove most of the bias, but if you use 
PFBA or THPFOS as external standards in methanol there are large biases.  So, 
you might have done some things that are not included in the methods of that 
paper.  If so let me know so I can figure all of this out.  Normally, I figure 
things out fairly easily, but this is eluding me.  
 
If you do not want to share the information so that I can come to the same 
conclusion that you have I understand.  I am having great difficulty 
understanding what you and Li did.  I thought that this might clarify my 
confusion.  At this point, after reviewing all of the spread sheets I simply 
cannot understand all that you did.  Perhaps a phone call between me you and Li 
will get things clarified for me.  Otherwise, I am not able to write anything 
about these studies.  
 
Thanks for you help.  I am working hard to try to get this paper out as fast as 
I can and apologize for being so slow.  The move, Emily's wedding and several 
surgeries have slowed my progress, but I am back on it and want to get it off 
my desk.  Sorry to be such a bother.
 
Sincerely,

John P. Giesy
