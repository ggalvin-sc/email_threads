Geary,

Sorry, I was in St. Louis Tuesday and was delayed getting home. I am
just getting caught up.  Can we meet this Monday afternoon?  Any time
after 2pm works for me.

I forgot to attach the corrected version of table 1 data and what I
called table 0 for the adults.  Here they are.

Geary,

Here are the results so far.  I still owe you an analysis of the
relationship between PFHS and age in kids adjusted for gender and a
writeup of the bootstrap and BCa estimates.

Geary,

I have done all the simple analyses for the kids, and am working on the
bootstrapped percentiles (90, 95, 99).  These chew up a lot of computer
time, since many iterations are necessary to get a reasonable confidence
limit.  I expect to finish these before I leave on vacation and will
send you the results as soon as they are complete.

I expect to have the adult data complete within a week after I return on
the 4th of September.

Call me if you have any questions or issues.

Tim

          Silvio - here is a copy of the amendment to the original protective order --
          it was modified in June 2003 to include confidential medical information.  I
 
          need to search further in my e-mail to locate the original - but that should
          be coming soon.  Also - I took a look at the public act that Robin cited and
          will call you to discuss.

I told him I cannot assist him.  He then went to Kannan.  When I found that

John: 
Please let me know how we can move forward.  As you suggested this may
be more political later.  Do we need to be involved?  I can call him
and say 'no' if you want to. 
Thanks,

          I attach comments from the industry group.  You will note there are some
          general points with questions, especially regarding the statistics on the
          length data, which do not necessarily require change to the draft report at
          present, followed by some specific suggestions for implementation in the
          report.
          Please let me know if any of our points are not clear.

          Jacques,
          To confirm that Bob Hoke has agreed that you should proceed with the
          statistics appendix as NON-GLP data.
          Since you are on holiday from 18 July to 8 August, can you arrange that it
          is possible to issue the final report in your absence ?  Please provide a
          contact name/email.
          In any event, please ensure that an electronic copy of the final report is
          sent to David Farrar and Georges Ransbotyn (addresses as per this message)
          as well as myself (since I will be on holiday myself from 25 July to 15
          August).  Also copy any other communications to them while I am away.
          If I can have the revised draft by the end of this week I will ensure that
          final comment and approval are sent before I go on holiday - also for the
          draft algal report.
          Regarding my visit, it is clear this cannot be before the planned end of the
          trout study, so I suggest Thursday 28 August, with the intention of going
          through the trout data in some detail.  If possible, please can you confirm
          this is OK before you start your holiday.
          Best regards
 
          Roy

          A brief reply as I am out of the office this afternoon and tomorrow.  I will
          forward your message to Bob Hoke but I expect that he will agree with my
          view that the statistical appendix should be given as NON-GLP data.  So
          please proceed with the revised draft on that basis - if my signature is not
          needed, please amend the 'Word' version of the Appendix that I sent you on 3
          July.  I will respond on my possible visit date when I return on Thursday.

          Roy,
          First of all, I apologize for the delay. I had hoped to respond to your last
          e-mails sooner but I had to face up to unexpected events the last week and
          the 14th July is a public holiday. Furthermore, I needed to wait for
          information from our Quality Assurance Unit regarding your statistics (see
          below).
          Please find below our responses to your questions (blue text).

          Objet : RE: APFO: Comments on draft Daphnia chronic report
          Jacques,
          Thank you for your responses, the sponsors would indeed prefer to include
          the statistics on the length data carried out by Dr Hoke, as you suggest is
          possible.  I have just received a description of the procedure from Dr Hoke,
          there are just a few minor points I need to check with him before I send
          this to you.  I assume that they would be included as an Appendix.
          Yes. Your statistical report will be included as an Appendix.
          I sincerely apologize for a slight misunderstanding concerning your
          statistics which occured in my last e-mail. Please be advised that I have
          just been informed by our Quality Assurance (the report is now audited) that
          the study is now considered as a multi-site study (a new legislation
          concerning these studies has been published by OECD in 2002) if your
          statistics are included in our report. These statistics will be considered
          as ""GLP"" (and stated as performed under GLP in our report) if Dr Hoke, as
          the ""Principal Investigator"" (PI), can provide us with an audited report,
          signed by himself, including a GLP statement and mentioning the PI ""Test
          Site"" address and the reference code of the ""statistical report"". In this
          case, could you please transfer to Dr Hoke the attached document (""PIDS
          22658 ECD.doc"") to be completed, signed and returned (by e-mail if possible
          and also by mail) to us.
          Otherwise and more simply and probably more rapidly, these statistics can be
 
          presented in our report as non-GLP data with your signature (as the Study
          Monitor) as a statement.
          Could you please confirm the reception of the ""PIDS"" and let me know your
          opinion.
          *       Please can you confim whether my signature is required on the pages
          that go in the report or whether this is needed just on a copy you hold in
          the archive ?
          Your signature on a copy we hold in the archive is sufficient in case of
          non-GLP statistical report (see above).
          *       Do you think it necessary (under your GLP) to have a signature of
          the person who carried out the statistics or is just mine sufficient ?
          The signature of Dr Hoke will be required in the statistical report in case
          of GLP report (see above).
          Regarding your other responses:
          *       I agree that it would be better not to make reference to your
          historical data for length if there is only one previous study.
          *       On reproduction, I suggest that you could add a sentence (perhaps
          immediately after the sentence in which the neonate numbers are listed)
          stating (or similar) ""The level of reproduction in the control (0 mg/l)  was
          within the range previously observed under these conditions in this
          laboratory"" but without reference to the actual historical values - but I
          leave the details to your judgement.
          I agree with your proposal.
          *         We are grateful for and agree the remaining responses.
          Thanks again for your efforts.  As you are aware, the EPA deadline for this
          was end of June, but I think it was worthwhile to clarify these statistics.
          We would be grateful if you could issue the report as soon as possible after
          I send you the statistics details - but please contact me if you have any
          questions.
          As several sections of the report have been revised, I propose to send to
          you before the end of this week by e-mail a new (audited) version, in the
          case of a non-GLP statistical report, so that you can verify the document
          before finalization. More time will probably be required for a GLP
          statistical report.
          I also need to ask when the draft algal report will be available - this was
          also originally promised to the EPA on the same timescale.
          We plan to send to you the draft algal report at the same time than the
          second version of the draft daphnid report (before the end of this week).
            I will assume that no news is good news on the trout study ? I will be in
          touch soon to arrange a visit.
          The end of the trout study is planned on 7 August. We have not completed
          analysis of all data generated during the last weeks. However, I will attach
          a brief summary of results obtained up to now in my next e-mail (reception
          by the end of this week) so that you can advise the sponsors of the study
          progress.
          It will be a pleasure to meet you soon at CIT to discuss about the results
          obtained in this trout chronic study. Please note that I will be on holiday
          between Friday 18 July midday and Friday 8 August. Regarding your visit,
          unfortunately, I can only propose a date convenient to you from 12 August
          (and if possible from 18 August). Could you please let me know the chosen
          date.
