Hi Sue

Thanks for the authorization to proceed with the 90-day study. Francois van Otterdijk will be your study director.
He also was responsible for the 28-day study. He has asked several questions regarding the study. Can you
please review and advise. Thanks very much in advance.

Sprague Dawley rats were used in the 28-day study. Wistar rats were mentioned in the 90-d quotation. Is this correct?
Based on the 28-day study results, we suggest to use 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day as dosages for the 90-day study. Dosages in the 28-day study
were 6, 30 and 150 mg/kg/day. At 30 mg/kg/day, males showed notably increased liver weights (27% increase towards control animals),
 along with hyperthrophy/hyperplasia of the thyroid and increased cholesterol levels. 
The amount of test substance left is approx 500 grams. Based on suggested dosages specified below approx. 40 grams would be
required. I.e. no need to send additional test substance.

Finalized study with John Butenhoff today. Draft of revised quote attached. Need to price with 3 week recovery group. Base price w/o
RF 87,950 euro so we just need to add cost of recovery to this. No TK just serum at termination to be returned to 3M for analysis. Test
article is ammonium PFBA (168273) for which OTF completed 28-day study so no RF study required. Also need to know how much
sample we have left and how much we will need for 90 by oral gavage. Timing is again critical. We gave him a start of 8-10 weeks from
 when everything was in-house. Is this still feasible? Can we start faster? Please review and advise. He is eager to sign and get project
underway.

Thanks and regards

and/or may have to forward to Sue Tanaka:
 
The study will have to be submitted  to the Animal Experimentation Commission. 
For approval, they need an extensive  rationale as to why this follow-up study 
is required. Has the study been  initiated and approved by EPA/State  of 
Minnesota?
 
Collection of serum:

How much serum should be collected, and  from how many animals/group?
Collection from aorta as part of necropsy  ok, or on a specific time point 
after the last dose on day 90?
Attn to whom should these serum samples be  sent?

Other questions:

Should animals be anaesthesized with  Ketamin/Dormitor as done for the 28-day 
study?
In the 28-day study we collected liver  samples for analyses to be conducted at 
3M/Minnesota University. Did these  analyses reveal any findings that may be 
useful for the dose selection?  Apparently, in the 90-day study no additional 
liver samples have to be  collected?
Sprague Dawley rats were used in the 28-day  study. Wistar rats were mentioned 
in the 90-d quotation. Is this  correct?

Based on the 28-day study results, we  suggest to use 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day as 
dosages for the 90-day study. Dosages in  the 28-day study were 6, 30 and 150 
mg/kg/day. At 30 mg/kg/day, males showed  notably increased liver weights (27% 
increase towards control animals), along  with hyperthrophy/hyperplasia of the 
thyroid and increased cholesterol  levels.
 
 
Many thanks,
 
With best regards,
Francois

Chris
 
Finalized study with John Butenhoff today. Draft of revised quote  attached. 
Need to price with 3 week recovery group. Base price w/o RF 87,950  euro so we 
just need to add cost of recovery to this. No TK just serum at  termination to 
be returned to 3M for analysis. Test article is ammonium PFBA  (168273) for 
which OTF completed 28-day study so no RF study required. Also  need to know 
how much sample we have left and how much we will need for 90 by  oral gavage. 
Timing is again critical. We gave him a start of 8-10 weeks from  when 
everything was in-house. Is this still feasible? Can we start faster?  Please 
review and advise. He is eager to sign and get project underway.
 
Thanks and regards
Robert

Dear Francois,
I apologize for this (very much) delayed reply. Things got quite busy in the last two weeks and I apologize in advance if this may have caused any inconvenience.
With regards to your questions, please see the replies below the questions (in bold text). We have not firmed up our study plan details and there is a possibility that
we might also add a couple of satellite groups for interim blood collection purpose. Several meetings are being planned before now and early next week, by which I
am hoping to provide you with much more details as they become available.
On a separate but related note, can you tell us when the revised draft report for the 28-day study might become available?
Please let me know if there is any question. As always, thanks for your kind help in this.
Regards,
Sue
===================================================================================================
The study will have to be submitted to the Animal Experimentation Commission. For approval, they need an extensive rationale as to why this
follow-up study is required. Has the study been initiated and approved by EPA/State of Minnesota? 
To my best knowledge, the study will be based on the following EPA guideline on 90-day study in rats. I will double check to make sure this is correct.
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Health Effects Test Guidelines, OPPTS 870-3100, 90-day oral toxicity in rodents. Office of Prevention, Pesticides
and Toxic Substances (7101), EPA 712-C-98-199, July 2000.
I am attaching the guideline document below for your reference.
(See attached file: EPA OPPTS 870.3100.pdf)

How much serum should be collected, and from how many animals/group?
Similar to our 28-day study, blood samples from all animals (probably n=20/sex/group) will be collected after last treatment so that clinical chemistries, hematology, and
clotting tests (like we did for the 28-day study) can be determined at the end of treatment. Half of the rats will be subsequentlhy sacrificed at the end of treatment while the
other half will be retained for another 21 days as recovery.
Collection from aorta as part of necropsy ok, or on a specific time point after the last dose on day 90?
Yes, blood collection from aorta is fine at necropsy. Let's use the same time schedules that were employed in our 28-day study.
Attn to whom should these serum samples be sent?
Similar to before, batches of flash-frozen livers and serum, as well as the cacodylate-fixed liver tissues shall be sent to:
Dave Ehresman (phone: 651-733-5070, fax: 651-737-4754, e-mail: djehresman@mmm.com)
3M Company
3M Center
236-C148
St. Paul, MN 55144
USA
RNA-later preserved liver samples shall be sent to:
Ken Wallace (phone: 218-726-8899, fax: 218-726-8014, e-mail: kwallace@d.umn.edu
Departement of Biochemistry& Molecular Biology
University of Minnesota Medical School
1035 University Drive
Duluth, MN 55812
USA
Should animals be anaesthesized with Ketamin/Dormitor as done for the 28-day study?
Yes 
In the 28-day study we collected liver samples for analyses to be conducted at 3M/Minnesota University. Did these analyses reveal any findings that
may be useful for the dose selection? Apparently, in the 90-day study no additional liver samples have to be collected?
See above, we will be interested in having the livers collected at this point.
Sprague Dawley rats were used in the 28-day study. Wistar rats were mentioned in the 90-d quotation. Is this correct?
Sprague Dawley rats should be used, not Wistar.
Based on the 28-day study results, we suggest to use 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day as dosages for the 90-day study. Dosages in the 28-day study were 6,
30 and 150 mg/kg/day. At 30 mg/kg/day, males showed notably increased liver weights (27% increase towards control animals), along with
hyperthrophy/hyperplasia of the thyroid and increased cholesterol levels. The amount of test substance left is approx 500 grams. Based on suggested
dosages specified below approx. 40 grams would be required. I.e. no need to send additional test substance.
As mentioned earlier, we have not firmed up the plan yet. But I will have additional test material (~ 200 g or so) send to your facility.

Dear Sue,
Thank you for your reply on our questions on the upcoming 90-day study. Please let us explain some of the points addressed in your
 email.
The study design for this study will deviate from the standard design described in the OPPTS guideline which we routinely use for EPA
study requirements. Therefore, the study will need advance approval from the Animal Experimentation Commission (AEC). Since the
study design is still subject to changes as you indicated, we will await your further information on this before the study is submitted to the
AEC. The AEC will nontheless require a rationale for conducting the study following the 28-day study which already used a significant
higher number of animals than the default number of animals described in the respective OPPTS guideline. Therefore, we enquired for
 more information as to the rationale for the study design and the request for a 90-day study in general. Having this information in advance
will speed up the approval procedure significantly. May we therefore kindly ask you to provide this information to us?
With regard to sending a revised draft of the 28-day study, we can inform you that the report has already been approved for finalisation
on 02 January 2007 (please refer to the email sent by Melinda Mitchell). On 4th January however, John Butenhoff informed us on the
deviating analytical results on test substance formulations. We responded that it would be best to await the full results and analytical
report from David Ehresman, and decide what further steps should be taken (eg correction for lower recovery, repeat analyses etc.). John
replied that he would discuss the matter with Paul and Dave. So far we have not received a response from 3M on this topic.
Further on the 28-day study report, a further detailed review of the raw data revealed that recovery group animals at the end of the
treatment period were inadvertently not anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor but with isoflurane instead. Prior to their necropsy
however, both Main and Recovery group animals were anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor. I.e. the wash-out period for any
 isoflurane metabolites may have been sufficiently long not to have adversely affected the analyses on serum samples collected at the end
of the recovery period. We do apologize for this occurrence, and will ensure that this will not happen in the 90-day study.
We look forward to receiving any updates on the study design of the 90-day study. In the meantime, please contact us in case of any
questions.
With best regards,
Francois

Collection from aorta as part of necropsy ok, or on a specific time point after the last dose on day 90 ?
Yes, blood collection from aorta is fine at necropsy. Let's use the same time schedules that were employed in our 28-day  study.
Attn to whom should these serum samples be sent?
Similar to before, batches of flash-frozen livers and serum, as well as the cacodylate-fixed liver tissues shall be sent  to:
Dave Ehresman (phone: 651-733-5070, fax: 651-737-4754, e-mail: djehresman@mmm. com)
3M Company
3M Center
236-C148
St. Paul, MN 55144
USA
RNA-later preserved liver samples shall be sent to:
Ken Wallace (phone: 218-726-8899, fax: 218-726-8014, e-mail: kwallace@d.umn. edu
Departement of Biochemistry& Molecular Biology
University of Minnesota Medical  School
1035 University Drive
Duluth, MN  55812
USA
Should animals be anaesthesized with Ketamin/Dormitor as done for the 28-day  study?
Yes
In the 28-day study we collected liver samples for analyses to be conducted at 3M/Minnesota University. Did these analyses
reveal any findings that may be useful for the dose selection? Apparently, in the 90-day study no additional liver samples have to
be collected?
See above, we will be interested in having the livers collected at this point.
Sprague Dawley rats were used in the 28-day study. Wistar rats were mentioned in the 90-d quotation. Is this  correct?
Sprague Dawley rats should be used, not Wistar .
Based on the 28-day study results, we suggest to use 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day as dosages for the 90-day study. Dosages in the
28-day study were 6, 30 and 150 mg/kg/day. At 30 mg/kg/day, males showed notably increased liver weights (27% increase
towards control animals), along with hyperthrophy/hyperplasia of the thyroid and increased cholesterol levels. The amount of
test substance left is approx 500 grams. Based on suggested dosages specified below approx. 40 grams would be required. I.e. no
need to send additional test substance .
As mentioned earlier, we have not firmed up the plan yet. But I will have additional test material (~ 200 g or so) send to your  facility.

Chris

Finalized study with John Butenhoff today. Draft of revised quote attached. Need to price with 3 week recovery group. Base price w/o
RF 87,950 euro so we just need to add cost of recovery to this. No TK just serum at termination to be returned to 3M for analysis. Test
article is ammonium PFBA (168273) for which OTF completed 28-day study so no RF study required. Also need to know how much
sample we have left and how much we will need for 90 by oral gavage. Timing is again critical. We gave him a start of 8-10 weeks from
 when everything was in-house. Is this still feasible? Can we start faster? Please review and advise. He is eager to sign and get project
underway.

Thanks and  regards

Dear Sue,
Thank you for your reply on our questions on the upcoming 90-day study. Please let us explain some of the points addressed in your
 email.
The study design for this study will deviate from the standard design described in the OPPTS guideline which we routinely use for EPA
study requirements. Therefore, the study will need advance approval from the Animal Experimentation Commission (AEC). Since the
study design is still subject to changes as you indicated, we will await your further information on this before the study is submitted to the
AEC. The AEC will nontheless require a rationale for conducting the study following the 28-day study which already used a significant
higher number of animals than the default number of animals described in the respective OPPTS guideline. Therefore, we enquired for
 more information as to the rationale for the study design and the request for a 90-day study in general. Having this information in advance
will speed up the approval procedure significantly. May we therefore kindly ask you to provide this information to us?
With regard to sending a revised draft of the 28-day study, we can inform you that the report has already been approved for finalisation
on 02 January 2007 (please refer to the email sent by Melinda Mitchell). On 4th January however, John Butenhoff informed us on the
deviating analytical results on test substance formulations. We responded that it would be best to await the full results and analytical
report from David Ehresman, and decide what further steps should be taken (eg correction for lower recovery, repeat analyses etc.). John
replied that he would discuss the matter with Paul and Dave. So far we have not received a response from 3M on this topic.
Further on the 28-day study report, a further detailed review of the raw data revealed that recovery group animals at the end of the
treatment period were inadvertently not anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor but with isoflurane instead. Prior to their necropsy
however, both Main and Recovery group animals were anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor. I.e. the wash-out period for any
 isoflurane metabolites may have been sufficiently long not to have adversely affected the analyses on serum samples collected at the end
of the recovery period. We do apologize for this occurrence, and will ensure that this will not happen in the 90-day study.
We look forward to receiving any updates on the study design of the 90-day study. In the meantime, please contact us in case of any
questions.
With best regards,
Francois

Dear Francois,
I apologize for this (very much) delayed reply. Things got quite busy in the last two weeks and I apologize in advance if this may have
caused any inconvenience .
With regards to your questions, please see the replies below the questions (in bold text). We have not firmed up our study plan details
and there is a possibility that we might also add a couple of satellite groups for interim blood collection purpose. Several meetings are
being planned before now and early next week, by which I am hoping to provide you with much more details as they become  available.
On a separate but related note, can you tell us when the revised draft report for the 28-day study might become  available?
Please let me know if there is any question. As always, thanks for your kind help in  this.
Regards,
Sue
 ===================================================================================================
The study will have to be submitted to the Animal Experimentation Commission. For approval, they need an extensive rationale
as to why this follow-up study is required. Has the study been initiated and approved by EPA/State of  Minnesota?
To my best knowledge, the study will be based on the following EPA guideline on 90-day study in rats. I will double check to make sure
this is correct.
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Health Effects Test Guidelines, OPPTS 870-3100, 90-day oral toxicity in
rodents. Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances (7101), EPA 712-C-98-199, July  2000.
I am attaching the guideline document below for your  reference. 

How much serum should be collected, and from how many animals/group?
Similar to our 28-day study, blood samples from all animals (probably n=20/sex/group) will be collected after last treatment so that
clinical chemistries, hematology, and clotting tests (like we did for the 28-day study) can be determined at the end of treatment. Half of
the rats will be subsequentlhy sacrificed at the end of treatment while the other half will be retained for another 21 days as recovery.
Collection from aorta as part of necropsy ok, or on a specific time point after the last dose on day 90 ?
Yes, blood collection from aorta is fine at necropsy. Let's use the same time schedules that were employed in our 28-day  study.

Chris

Finalized study with John Butenhoff today. Draft of revised quote attached. Need to price with 3 week recovery group. Base price w/o
RF 87,950 euro so we just need to add cost of recovery to this. No TK just serum at termination to be returned to 3M for analysis. Test
article is ammonium PFBA (168273) for which OTF completed 28-day study so no RF study required. Also need to know how much
sample we have left and how much we will need for 90 by oral gavage. Timing is again critical. We gave him a start of 8-10 weeks from
 when everything was in-house. Is this still feasible? Can we start faster? Please review and advise. He is eager to sign and get project
underway.

Thanks and  regards

Dear Francois,

I apologize for this (very much) delayed reply.  Things got quite busy in the 
last two weeks and I apologize in advance if this may have caused any 
inconvenience.

With regards to your questions, please see the replies below the questions (in 
bold text).  We have not firmed up our study plan details and there is a 
possibility that we might also add a couple of satellite groups for interim 
blood collection purpose.  Several meetings are being planned before now and 
early next week, by which I am hoping to provide you with much more details as 
they become available.

On a separate but related note, can you tell us when the revised draft report 
for the 28-day study might become available?  

Please let me know if there is any question.  As always, thanks for your kind 
help in this.

Regards,

Sue

================================================================================
===================

The study will have to be submitted to the  Animal Experimentation Commission. 
For approval, they need an extensive  rationale as to why this follow-up study 
is required. Has the study been  initiated and approved by EPA/State  of 
Minnesota?

To my best knowledge, the study will be based on the following EPA guideline on 
90-day study in rats.  I will double check to make sure this is correct.

United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Health Effects Test 
Guidelines, OPPTS 870-3100, 90-day oral toxicity in rodents. Office of 
Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances (7101), EPA 712-C-98-199, July 2000.

I am attaching the guideline document below for your reference.



 
How much serum should be collected, and  from how many animals/group? 

Similar to our 28-day study, blood samples from all animals (probably 
n=20/sex/group) will be collected after last treatment so that clinical 
chemistries, hematology, and clotting tests (like we did for the 28-day study) 
can be determined at the end of treatment.  Half of the rats will be 
subsequentlhy sacrificed at the end of treatment while the other half will be 
retained for another 21 days as recovery. 

Collection from aorta as part of necropsy  ok, or on a specific time point 
after the last dose on day 90?  

Yes, blood collection from aorta is fine at necropsy.  Let's use the same time 
schedules that were employed in our 28-day study.

Attn to whom should these serum samples  be sent?  

Similar to before, batches of flash-frozen livers and serum, as well as the 
cacodylate-fixed liver tissues shall be sent to:

Dave Ehresman (phone:  651-733-5070, fax:  651-737-4754, e-mail: 
djehresman@mmm.com)
3M Company
3M Center
236-C148
St. Paul, MN  55144 
USA 

RNA-later preserved liver samples shall be sent to:

Ken Wallace (phone:  218-726-8899, fax:  218-726-8014, e-mail: 
kwallace@d.umn.edu
Departement of Biochemistry& Molecular Biology
University of Minnesota Medical School
1035 University Drive
Duluth, MN 55812
USA

Should animals be anaesthesized with  Ketamin/Dormitor as done for the 28-day 
study?

Yes

In the 28-day study we collected liver  samples for analyses to be conducted at 
3M/Minnesota University. Did these  analyses reveal any findings that may be 
useful for the dose selection?  Apparently, in the 90-day study no additional 
liver samples have to be  collected?

See above, we will be interested in having the livers collected at this point.  

Sprague Dawley rats were used in the  28-day study. Wistar rats were mentioned 
in the 90-d quotation. Is this  correct?

Sprague Dawley rats should be used, not Wistar.

Based on the 28-day study results, we  suggest to use 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day as 
dosages for the 90-day study. Dosages  in the 28-day study were 6, 30 and 150 
mg/kg/day. At 30 mg/kg/day, males  showed notably increased liver weights (27% 
increase towards control animals),  along with hyperthrophy/hyperplasia of the 
thyroid and increased cholesterol  levels.  The amount of test substance left 
is approx  500 grams. Based on suggested dosages  specified below approx. 40 
grams would be required. I.e. no need to send  additional test substance.

As mentioned earlier, we have not firmed up the plan yet.  But I will have 
additional test material (~ 200 g or so) send to your facility.

Hi Sue
 
Thanks for the authorization to proceed with the 90-day  study. Francois van 
Otterdijk will be your study director. He also was  responsible for the 28-day 
study. He has asked several questions regarding the  study. Can you please 
review and advise. Thanks very much in  advance.

Dear  Sue,

Thank  you for your reply on our questions on the upcoming 90-day study.  
Please let us explain some of the points addressed in your  email.

The  study design for this study will deviate from the standard design 
described in  the OPPTS guideline which we routinely use for EPA study 
requirements.  Therefore, the study will need advance approval from the Animal 
Experimentation  Commission (AEC). Since the study design is still subject to 
changes as you  indicated, we will await your further information on this 
before the study  is submitted to the AEC. The AEC will nontheless require a 
rationale  for conducting the study following the 28-day study which already 
used a  significant higher number of animals than the default number of 
animals  described in the respective OPPTS guideline. Therefore, we enquired 
for  more information as to the rationale for the study design and the request 
for a  90-day study in general. Having this information in advance will speed 
up the  approval procedure significantly. May we therefore kindly ask you to 
provide  this information to us?

With  regard to sending a revised draft of the 28-day study, we can inform you 
that  the report has already been approved for finalisation on 02 January 2007 
(please  refer to the email sent by Melinda Mitchell). On 4th January however, 
John  Butenhoff informed us on the deviating analytical results on test 
substance  formulations. We responded that it would be best to await the full 
results and  analytical report from David Ehresman, and decide what further 
steps should be  taken (eg correction for lower recovery, repeat analyses 
etc.). John replied  that he would discuss the matter with Paul and Dave. So 
far we have not  received a response from 3M on this topic. 

Further  on the 28-day study report, a further detailed review of the raw data  
revealed that recovery group animals at the end of the treatment period were  
inadvertently not anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor but with isoflurane  
instead. Prior to their necropsy however, both Main and Recovery group animals  
were anaesthesized with Ketamine/Dormitor. I.e. the wash-out period for any  
isoflurane metabolites may have been sufficiently long not to have adversely  
affected the analyses on serum samples collected at the end of the recovery  
period.  We do apologize for this occurrence, and will ensure that this  will 
not happen in the 90-day study.

We look  forward to receiving any updates on the study design of the 90-day 
study. In the  meantime, please contact us in case of any questions.

With  best regards,

Francois

Dear Francois, 

I apologize  for this (very much) delayed reply.  Things got quite busy in the 
last  two weeks and I apologize in advance if this may have caused any  
inconvenience. 

With regards to  your questions, please see the replies below the questions (in 
bold text).   We have not firmed up our study plan details and there is a 
possibility  that we might also add a couple of satellite groups for interim 
blood  collection purpose.  Several meetings are being planned before now and  
early next week, by which I am hoping to provide you with much more details as  
they become available. 

On a  separate but related note, can you tell us when the revised draft report 
for  the 28-day study might become available?   

Please let me know if there is any question.  As  always, thanks for your kind 
help in this. 

Regards, 

Sue 

================================================================================
===================  

The study will have to be  submitted to the  Animal Experimentation Commission. 
For approval, they  need an extensive  rationale as to why this follow-up study 
is required.  Has the study been  initiated and approved by EPA/State  of  
Minnesota? 

To my best  knowledge, the study will be based on the following EPA guideline 
on 90-day  study in rats.  I will double check to make sure this is correct.  

United States Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA). Health Effects Test 
Guidelines, OPPTS 870-3100,  90-day oral toxicity in rodents. Office of 
Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic  Substances (7101), EPA 712-C-98-199, July 
2000. 

I am attaching the guideline document below for  your reference. 



  
How much  serum should be collected, and  from how many animals/group?  

Similar to our 28-day  study, blood samples from all animals (probably 
n=20/sex/group) will be  collected after last treatment so that clinical 
chemistries, hematology, and  clotting tests (like we did for the 28-day study) 
can be determined at the end  of treatment.  Half of the rats will be 
subsequentlhy sacrificed at the  end of treatment while the other half will be 
retained for another 21 days as  recovery. 

Collection from  aorta as part of necropsy  ok, or on a specific time point 
after the last  dose on day 90?   

Yes, blood collection from aorta is fine at necropsy.  Let's use  the same time 
schedules that were employed in our 28-day study.  

Attn to whom should these serum  samples  be sent?   

Similar to before, batches of flash-frozen livers and serum, as well as  the 
cacodylate-fixed liver tissues shall be sent to: 

Dave Ehresman (phone:  651-733-5070, fax:   651-737-4754, e-mail: 
djehresman@mmm.com) 
3M Company 
3M Center 
236-C148  
St. Paul, MN  55144  
USA 

RNA-later preserved liver samples shall be sent  to: 

Ken Wallace (phone:   218-726-8899, fax:  218-726-8014, e-mail: 
kwallace@d.umn.edu  
Departement of Biochemistry&  Molecular Biology 
University of  Minnesota Medical School 
1035  University Drive 
Duluth, MN  55812 
USA 

Should animals be anaesthesized with   Ketamin/Dormitor as done for the 28-day 
study? 

Yes 

In the 28-day study we collected liver  samples for analyses to  be conducted 
at 3M/Minnesota University. Did these  analyses reveal any  findings that may 
be useful for the dose selection?  Apparently, in the  90-day study no 
additional liver samples have to be   collected? 

See  above, we will be interested in having the livers collected at this 
point.    

Sprague Dawley rats  were used in the  28-day study. Wistar rats were mentioned 
in the  90-d quotation. Is this  correct? 

Sprague Dawley rats should be used, not  Wistar. 

Based on the  28-day study results, we  suggest to use 1, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day as 
dosages  for the 90-day study. Dosages  in the 28-day study were 6, 30 and 150  
mg/kg/day. At 30 mg/kg/day, males  showed notably increased liver weights  (27% 
increase towards control animals),  along with  hyperthrophy/hyperplasia of the 
thyroid and increased cholesterol   levels.  The amount of test substance left 
is approx  500  grams. Based on suggested dosages  specified below approx. 40 
grams  would be required. I.e. no need to send  additional test  substance. 

As mentioned  earlier, we have not firmed up the plan yet.  But I will have 
additional  test material (~ 200 g or so) send to your facility.

Hi  Sue 
  
Thanks for the  authorization to proceed with the 90-day  study. Francois van 
Otterdijk  will be your study director. He also was  responsible for the 
28-day  study. He has asked several questions regarding the  study. Can you  
please review and advise. Thanks very much in  advance.

Dear Robert, 
   
The amount of test substance left is approx  500 grams.  Based on suggested 
dosages  specified below approx. 40 grams would  be required. I.e. no need to 
send  additional test substance.  
  
I have not yet received a  planning, but I am  sure they are eagerly working on 
it! 
  
Some additional questions on the  referred quotation you may be able to  answer 
and/or may have to forward  to Sue Tanaka:

Chris 
  
Finalized  study with John Butenhoff today. Draft of revised quote  attached. 
Need  to price with 3 week recovery group. Base price w/o RF 87,950  euro so 
we  just need to add cost of recovery to this. No TK just serum at  
 termination to be returned to 3M for analysis. Test article is ammonium  PFBA 
 (168273) for which OTF completed 28-day study so no RF study  required. Also 
 need to know how much sample we have left and how much we  will need for 90 by 
 oral gavage. Timing is again critical. We gave him a  start of 8-10 weeks from 
 when everything was in-house. Is this still  feasible? Can we start faster? 
 Please review and advise. He is eager to  sign and get project underway. 
  
Thanks and regards 
Robert

Dale -
I assume you are going to ask Giesy to refer the writer to me?  You can have 
him give her my phone number - 651-733-1135 - or you can have him say that I'll 
call her.  Just let me know which way it will be.  Thanks.

Joe,

Larry is in Europe this week.  I will discuss with him upon his return.  Larry 
provided me your cost estimate for the cancer case cohrot studies but I don't 
have anything for the Danish birth cohort analyses (at least I don't think 
so).  Have you sent this to Larry?

Geary

larry and geary,  below is a communication from jorn olsen regarding the 
potential mother-offspring study. he and iei have been negotiating for months 
and working on a written proposal for the last week or so. currently he holds 
the epi chair at ucla but is still the principal investigator of the danish 
national birth cohort, among other things (e.g., he's president of the IEA).  
the governmental approvals are quite time consuming for this particular cohort 
and he would like to know when he could expect to know whether he will be 
funded, as he believes it is more efficient and more promising to cinch the ok 
if these approval bodies are approached  with funding in hand. obviously, i am 
not asking for any commitment on your part but just an estimate as to when you 
might reach a decision on this proposed component of the pfos/pfoa research, 
assuming i can get a draft proposal to you in the next week or so.  thanks.  joe

Joe what is the expected time schedule?

 

 

We have sent the application to the Steering committee and will probably know 
more in 2-3 weeks but I guess they will say yes.

 

The next steps are time consuming and I would want to have funding in place 
before we contact the IRB, Data Inspectorate etc.

Hi!

Here's the document with the budget updated.  In the meantime I need to put 
the UCLA portion through process.  I'll need to know the name and mailing 
address for who to send it to in Denmark.

Thanks!

Joe,

Larry is in Europe this week.  I will discuss with him upon his return.  Larry 
provided me your cost estimate for the cancer case cohrot studies but I don't 
have anything for the Danish birth cohort analyses (at least I don't think 
so).  Have you sent this to Larry?

Geary

larry and geary,  below is a communication from jorn olsen regarding the 
potential mother-offspring study. he and iei have been negotiating for months 
and working on a written proposal for the last week or so. currently he holds 
the epi chair at ucla but is still the principal investigator of the danish 
national birth cohort, among other things (e.g., he's president of the IEA).  
the governmental approvals are quite time consuming for this particular cohort 
and he would like to know when he could expect to know whether he will be 
funded, as he believes it is more efficient and more promising to cinch the ok 
if these approval bodies are approached  with funding in hand. obviously, i am 
not asking for any commitment on your part but just an estimate as to when you 
might reach a decision on this proposed component of the pfos/pfoa research, 
assuming i can get a draft proposal to you in the next week or so.  thanks.  joe

Joe what is the expected time schedule?

 

 

We have sent the application to the Steering committee and will probably know 
more in 2-3 weeks but I guess they will say yes.

 

The next steps are time consuming and I would want to have funding in place 
before we contact the IRB, Data Inspectorate etc.

Hi!

Here's the document with the budget updated.  In the meantime I need to put 
the UCLA portion through process.  I'll need to know the name and mailing 
address for who to send it to in Denmark.

Thanks!

larry and geary,  below is a communication from jorn olsen regarding the
potential mother-offspring study. he and iei have been negotiating for
months and working on a written proposal for the last week or so. currently
he holds the epi chair at ucla but is still the principal investigator of
the danish national birth cohort, among other things (e.g., he's president
of the IEA).  the governmental approvals are quite time consuming for this
particular cohort and he would like to know when he could expect to know
whether he will be funded, as he believes it is more efficient and more
promising to cinch the ok if these approval bodies are approached  with
funding in hand. obviously, i am not asking for any commitment on your part
but just an estimate as to when you might reach a decision on this proposed
component of the pfos/pfoa research, assuming i can get a draft proposal to
you in the next week or so.  thanks.  joe

      Joe what is the expected time schedule?





      We have sent the application to the Steering committee and will
      probably know more in 2-3 weeks but I guess they will say yes.



      The next steps are time consuming and I would want to have funding in
      place before we contact the IRB, Data Inspectorate etc.

      Hi!

      Here's the document with the budget updated.  In the meantime I need
      to put
      the UCLA portion through process.  I'll need to know the name and
      mailing
      address for who to send it to in Denmark.

      Thanks!

          Done!
          I sent a reply two days ago and copied everyone that was on the original E-mail. For reference, attached 
          is a copy of my reply. We are also in direct contact with Ford's Toxicity group through the GADSL 
          committee (Global Automotive Declarable Substance List). This is the group that would handle any 
          materials of concern.

          I'm the Automotive Segment Manager for DuPont's Fluoropolymers such as Teflon(R) and Tefzel(R) and 
          your primary contact for questions related to PFOAs and the EPA's voluntary reduction program. 
          In reply to the attached E-mail, there will be no supply interruptions with DuPont's Fluoropolymers as 
          PFOA is phased out by 2015. DuPont has been leading the global effort to reduce PFOA in the 
          environment and at the end of 2005, we have already reduced emissions by 94%.  
          PFOA is a process aid. As such, most of our finished products contain no PFOA in them.  
          DuPont has a website that discusses PFOA in detail at 
          http://www2.dupont.com/PFOA/en_US/index.html. 
           
          Extensive testing has been done in the industry and there are no documented cases of serious human 
          health effects. Because PFOA is persistant and does not bio-degrade, DuPont has led the industry to 
          remove it from our products. 
          Attached is a recent press announcement from DuPont in regards to the EPA's voluntary program.

          The DCSE folks are correct--this is an inquiry we need to field from Ford as soon as possible.  Can you 
          please work with the ""usual suspects""  (Buxton and/or Raiford) to answer.  Call me if you need to discuss 
          further.
          Thanks

          Let's start with what does Ford buy from DuPont in terms of either Fluorpolymer or Fluorotelomers?  
          Particularly for the ATEO uses.
          If that data is handy then it is easier to move in the right direction.
          I will help however I can.

          I sent a reply two days ago and copied everyone that was on the original E-mail. For reference, attached 
          is a copy of my reply. We are also in direct contact with Ford's Toxicity group through the GADSL 
          committee (Global Automotive Declarable Substance List). This is the group that would handle any 
          materials of concern.

          I'm the Automotive Segment Manager for DuPont's Fluoropolymers such as Teflon(R) and Tefzel(R) and 
          your primary contact for questions related to PFOAs and the EPA's voluntary reduction program. 
          In reply to the attached E-mail, there will be no supply interruptions with DuPont's Fluoropolymers as 
          PFOA is phased out by 2015. DuPont has been leading the global effort to reduce PFOA in the 
          environment and at the end of 2005, we have already reduced emissions by 94%.  
          PFOA is a process aid. As such, most of our finished products contain no PFOA in them.  
          DuPont has a website that discusses PFOA in detail at 
          http://www2.dupont.com/PFOA/en_US/index.html. 
           
          Extensive testing has been done in the industry and there are no documented cases of serious human 
          health effects. Because PFOA is persistant and does not bio-degrade, DuPont has led the industry to 
          remove it from our products. 
          Attached is a recent press announcement from DuPont in regards to the EPA's voluntary program.

          The DCSE folks are correct--this is an inquiry we need to field from Ford as soon as possible.  Can you 
          please work with the ""usual suspects""  (Buxton and/or Raiford) to answer.  Call me if you need to discuss 
          further.

          Let's start with what does Ford buy from DuPont in terms of either Fluorpolymer or Fluorotelomers?  
          Particularly for the ATEO uses.
          If that data is handy then it is easier to move in the right direction.
 
          I will help however I can.

          Rick,
          It's great that you got back to them so quickly, but there are a couple of issues with your messaging.  
          Please give me a call and I'll work through these with you.  I expect this won't be the last one, so let's talk 
          about our process for fielding these inquiries in writing (the language of which requires corporate 
          approval) as they come in the future, as well as any further clarification that may be required for Ford on 
          this one.  I look forward to hearing from you.

          Done!
          I sent a reply two days ago and copied everyone that was on the original E-mail. For reference, attached 
          is a copy of my reply. We are also in direct contact with Ford's Toxicity group through the GADSL 
          committee (Global Automotive Declarable Substance List). This is the group that would handle any 
          materials of concern.

          I'm the Automotive Segment Manager for DuPont's Fluoropolymers such as Teflon(R) and Tefzel(R) and 
          your primary contact for questions related to PFOAs and the EPA's voluntary reduction program. 
          In reply to the attached E-mail, there will be no supply interruptions with DuPont's Fluoropolymers as 
          PFOA is phased out by 2015. DuPont has been leading the global effort to reduce PFOA in the 
          environment and at the end of 2005, we have already reduced emissions by 94%.  
          PFOA is a process aid. As such, most of our finished products contain no PFOA in them.  
          DuPont has a website that discusses PFOA in detail at 
          http://www2.dupont.com/PFOA/en_US/index.html. 
           
          Extensive testing has been done in the industry and there are no documented cases of serious human 
          health effects. Because PFOA is persistant and does not bio-degrade, DuPont has led the industry to 
          remove it from our products. 
          Attached is a recent press announcement from DuPont in regards to the EPA's voluntary program.

          Rick,
          The DCSE folks are correct--this is an inquiry we need to field from Ford as soon as possible.  Can you 
          please work with the ""usual suspects""  (Buxton and/or Raiford) to answer.  Call me if you need to discuss 
          further.
          Thanks

          Let's start with what does Ford buy from DuPont in terms of either Fluorpolymer or Fluorotelomers?  
          Particularly for the ATEO uses.
          If that data is handy then it is easier to move in the right direction.
          I will help however I can.

          Is there any risk to ATEO with (PFOA)Perfluorooctanoic acid.  There may be a possible ban on using the 
          material by 2015.  Pleae get with your chemists and Tox people to see if there will be any future issues.  
          It is used in the manufacture of certain fluoropolymers.  Please report back.

 Dear Dr. Giesy,                                                                                     
 I am an internist in Birmingham, and am interested in measuring a subgroup of                       
 patients for PFOS. I can order PFOA, but not PFOS from a commercial lab. I saw your                 
 name mentioned in an article on PFOS (Env Science & Techn) , and wonder if you can                  
 you run these PFOS assays for me, on a fee basis?                                                   
 Is finding PFOA roughly eguivalent to finding PFOS, and are the levels parallel?                    
 Thanks

Dear Mike and Dale: 
I received this request from a physician.  I also got another request from a
physician who wants to have hundreds of samples measured for PFOS for
$500/sample.  I have told both of them that we are not in a position to
assist them.  From what I can gather a number of attorneys around the country
are contemplating class action suits, but I am not certain that this is the
interest in these most recent cases.  Since we do not do human blood in our
studies, I declined to discuss the issue in detail with these individuals.
Please let me know if you have additional information or wan to discuss this
information in more detail.

Dear Dr. Giesy,
I am an internist in Birmingham, and am interested in measuring a subgroup of patients for PFOS.  I can order PFOA, but not PFOS from a commercial lab. I saw your name mentioned in an article on PFOS (Env Science & Techn) , and wonder if you can you run these PFOS assays for me, on a fee basis?
Is finding PFOA roughly equivalent to finding PFOS, and are the levels parallel?
Thanks

Dr. Geisy,
I got your name from an Amer. Chem. Society Abstract on tissue tests for 
PFOS.   I have a client in the Wash. DC area that desires to have human blood 
analyzed for PFOS.   I am not sure of the number of samples: however, if your 
lab would be interested in performing these tests, than I will get more 
details.  Please let me know ASAP of your interest.

          Steve,
          As requested, I have attached our wellfield pumping data for the month of
          August 2002.  Please note that this data is normally recorded at about 8:00
          to 10:00 AM each day.  Therefore, data recorded for August 9th is actually
          for pumpage from about 9:00 AM August 8th to about 9:00 AM August 9th.
          The pumping data for Tuesday, August 20, 2002, was taken from a totalizer
          chart (midnight August 19th to midnight August 20th), and is as follows:
          00:00 to 06:30     680 gpm (Wells 2&3)
          06:30 to 11:00         0 gpm (All wells were off)
          11:00 to 13:15     700 gpm (Wells 2&3)
          13:15 to 24:00     910 gpm (Wells 1, 2, & 3)
          As soon as the GPS data is available, either Linda or I will forward it to
          you.
          Have a good day.
          Regards,
          Bob

          Unfortunately, they have given us the hourly details for August 20, 2002.  We actually need this 
          information for the next day, August 21, 2002, which is the day that the water levels were measured.  Can 
          we make another request?  It is important that I have this information for the model due to the rapid 
          response of the aquifer to changes in pumping stress.
          Thanks,

Dear Bill,

...sorry but it took my research services offices exactly 5 days
minus 15 minutes to get back to me with a draft agreement. it is
attached.  I've put in draft dates etc.  I've also updated the
proposal a wee bit given progress and some new ideas we have on
temporal monitoring.

thoughts?

the contact for now in research services is Homer Henry:

I'm ccing chemistry's own grants officer (Judy Hon) on this email and
you can liase with her as well and particularly to help shepherd this
through the process.

          Jayne,
          In reply to your e-mail dated January 25, I am attaching-in blue- ""old"" e-mail on the subject, for our 
          teleconference today at 10AM your time on budgets,
          (see also the word document in Susan's e-mail dated November 9)
          I am afraid there may be  some confusion about budgets.Europe needs a budget , not only for Sprim but 
          also for the people working on the issue ..(see the word document attached in the e-mail of Susan 
          Stalnecker dated November 9)
          The Sprim contract is 400M $ plus their travel expenses still for this year.I addition we have the people 
          dedicated to the issue: myself(50%) Alex (50%) and James (100%). In addition several other people are 
          working part time on the issue,(regulatory and tox) 
          It had been my understanding that the budget for crisis communications was dedicated to this
          let's sort tit out later today,
          regards,Gaston,
          Hi Gaston.
          I can now answer  some of your question.  Indeed, we did receive the approval to proceed with the 
          communications budget, including Alex's charges (is he 50% to our budget or 100%?).  For the European 
          Communications budget, we will have the following:
          - Crisis Communications (i.e., PA)  -- $.75MM ($750,000)
          - Brand Defense (i.e., MC & PR) -- $.75MM (to be shared between FPS and DCSE to keep the brand 
          safe)
          It may be best to arrange a call to discuss the intentions of both Communications budgets so that we are 
          all clear on expectations of the use of the budgets and the process to get approval to spend.  This call 
          should be within the next couple of weeks.  I propose I visit your team in January to plan for 2007 and 
          discuss managing processes.  This would also include Renee and Martin.
            
          Please let me know if you have thoughts/comments on the above.  
          Thanks.

          In below communication, Susan had been asking for confirmation of next year's budgets.
          So far I have not yet received  any further news,
          Since our commitments (Sprim & other) have been agreed already this year for a 2 years period, I am 
          anxious to get confirmation of the for Europe in 2007 for Issue Management,
          Are you in a position to confirm my budget ?
          Thanks for your help, Gaston

          Dear Susan:
          Catching up to wrap up 2007 budget discussions, I have been reminded  to confirm funding for the Issue 
          management activities in 2007 (Alex, James, SPRIM etc.). Did you get confirmation from Ellen and for 
          which amount so that I can reconcile with Gaston (on vacation this week) and our Financial analyst.. to 
          avoid both doublebookings or ""falls in the cracks"".  If there is anybody else we should now be talking to 
          (Tom Rossiter, Jayne, Kathy?), just  let us know..

          Alex,
          Kathy and I discussed the European Budget today.  We are sharing the SPRIM cost.  So, please reduce 
          your PA budget to $500M vs. the earlier budget figure of $750M.  Renee, the MC amount for FLPR is still 
          $375M.  The PA budget is expected to cover ongoing monitoring and tracking, media events and 
          response (minimizing news cycles and scope).   The MC budget is for brand sustainability and brand 
          defense.  
          The next step is to work through our managing process for the budget.  I suggest we speak next week to 
          get that discussion started.  I have some thoughts, but I would like to hear how you, Gaston and Renee 
          think the process could be managed. I'll ask Joan to get some time on the calendar.
          Take care,
          Jayne

          I have planned for the 50% of Alex in Crisis Communications.   We'll need to talk with Kathy McCord 
          about the other administrative costs.  Perhaps we could talk with her after the SPRIM discussion (if you 
          have a couple of minutes between the presentation and dinner)?

          Jayne,
          In reply to your e-mail dated January 25, I am attaching-in blue- ""old"" e-mail on the subject, for our 
          teleconference today at 10AM your time on budgets,
          (see also the word document in Susan's e-mail dated November 9)
          I am afraid there may be  some confusion about budgets.Europe needs a budget , not only for Sprim but 
          also for the people working on the issue ..(see the word document attached in the e-mail of Susan 
          Stalnecker dated November 9)
          The Sprim contract is 400M $ plus their travel expenses still for this year.I addition we have the people 
          dedicated to the issue: myself(50%) Alex (50%) and James (100%). In addition several other people are 
          working part time on the issue,(regulatory and tox) 
          It had been my understanding that the budget for crisis communications was dedicated to this
          let's sort tit out later today,
          regards,Gaston,

          I can now answer  some of your question.  Indeed, we did receive the approval to proceed with the 
          communications budget, including Alex's charges (is he 50% to our budget or 100%?).  For the European 
          Communications budget, we will have the following:
          - Crisis Communications (i.e., PA)  -- $.75MM ($750,000)
          - Brand Defense (i.e., MC & PR) -- $.75MM (to be shared between FPS and DCSE to keep the brand 
          safe)
          It may be best to arrange a call to discuss the intentions of both Communications budgets so that we are 
          all clear on expectations of the use of the budgets and the process to get approval to spend.  This call 
          should be within the next couple of weeks.  I propose I visit your team in January to plan for 2007 and 
          discuss managing processes.  This would also include Renee and Martin.
            
          Please let me know if you have thoughts/comments on the above.  
          Thanks.

          Alex,
          Kathy and I discussed the European Budget today.  We are sharing the SPRIM cost.  So, please reduce 
          your PA budget to $500M vs. the earlier budget figure of $750M.  Renee, the MC amount for FLPR is still 
          $375M.  The PA budget is expected to cover ongoing monitoring and tracking, media events and 
          response (minimizing news cycles and scope).   The MC budget is for brand sustainability and brand 
          defense.  
          The next step is to work through our managing process for the budget.  I suggest we speak next week to 
          get that discussion started.  I have some thoughts, but I would like to hear how you, Gaston and Renee 
          think the process could be managed. I'll ask Joan to get some time on the calendar.
          Take care,

          I have planned for the 50% of Alex in Crisis Communications.   We'll need to talk with Kathy McCord 
          about the other administrative costs.  Perhaps we could talk with her after the SPRIM discussion (if you 
          have a couple of minutes between the presentation and dinner)?

          Jayne,
          In reply to your e-mail dated January 25, I am attaching-in blue- ""old"" e-mail on the subject, for our 
          teleconference today at 10AM your time on budgets,
          (see also the word document in Susan's e-mail dated November 9)
          I am afraid there may be  some confusion about budgets.Europe needs a budget , not only for Sprim but 
          also for the people working on the issue ..(see the word document attached in the e-mail of Susan 
          Stalnecker dated November 9)
          The Sprim contract is 400M $ plus their travel expenses still for this year.I addition we have the people 
          dedicated to the issue: myself(50%) Alex (50%) and James (100%). In addition several other people are 
          working part time on the issue,(regulatory and tox) 
          It had been my understanding that the budget for crisis communications was dedicated to this
          let's sort tit out later today,
          regards,Gaston,

          I can now answer  some of your question.  Indeed, we did receive the approval to proceed with the 
          communications budget, including Alex's charges (is he 50% to our budget or 100%?).  For the European 
          Communications budget, we will have the following:
          - Crisis Communications (i.e., PA)  -- $.75MM ($750,000)
          - Brand Defense (i.e., MC & PR) -- $.75MM (to be shared between FPS and DCSE to keep the brand 
          safe)
          It may be best to arrange a call to discuss the intentions of both Communications budgets so that we are 
          all clear on expectations of the use of the budgets and the process to get approval to spend.  This call 
          should be within the next couple of weeks.  I propose I visit your team in January to plan for 2007 and 
          discuss managing processes.  This would also include Renee and Martin.
            
          Please let me know if you have thoughts/comments on the above.  
          Thanks.

          Are you in a position to confirm my budget ?

          Dear Susan:
          Catching up to wrap up 2007 budget discussions, I have been reminded  to confirm funding for the Issue 
          management activities in 2007 (Alex, James, SPRIM etc.). Did you get confirmation from Ellen and for 
          which amount so that I can reconcile with Gaston (on vacation this week) and our Financial analyst.. to 
          avoid both doublebookings or ""falls in the cracks"".  If there is anybody else we should now be talking to 
          (Tom Rossiter, Jayne, Kathy?), just  let us know..
          Thanks and again best wishes in your new assignment!

Body:
Bill:
I have been in touch with Dr. John Giesy as he contacted me last week asking me 
to provide some material/writeup for the method validation paper.  Based on our 
recent correspondences, I think we lost our original intent/goal of the study.  
I thought that we working working developing a more refined method by comparing 
3 extractionmethods and 3 quantitation methods with 3 types of blood matrices. 
However,  John is talking a lot about retracking my paper in ES&T published in 
2004 on blood analysis from several countries.  I have no base why that paper 
needs to be retracted.  To me it appears that it is not going anywhere and my 
student is too busy working on her thesis project.  We cannot continue working 
for nothing.  I have sent the following mail to John.  I will forward a few 
other mails that we communicated to keep you in loop.

John:
Lin and I have spent more time on this project, desptite no funds from any 
source, to help you and Bill and 3M as a whole.  But we do not seem to go 
anywhere with this project and it does not seem to benefit us in any way.  
Unfortunetely, this is not a part of Lin's thesis work and she is reluctant to 
keep working on this for nothing. I do not understand how you come up with a 
bias of 1000% without having our results for those individual samples.  I do 
not beleive this.  Our values match exactly with what Bill Reagen had produced 
and it is confirmed again by several earlier studies and I do not want to waste 
my time working on this.  Because it takes too much of our time, I have to give 
up on this although we had spent quite a lot of time.

My focus is on the validated method, but I have been reviewing the results in 
great detail and was just trying to help.  I understand your position.  I 
disagree, but understand you position.  I have looked at what you did and then 
tried to do the same thin in my own lab and find about a 1000%-fold bias using 
the methods that you indicated that you used in that paper.  The biggest issues 
are for PFOA.  For PFBS there are to biases that would cancel each other out.  
If you use internal standards you can remove most of the bias, but if you use 
PFBA or THPFOS as external standards in methanol there are large biases.  So, 
you might have done some things that are not included in the methods of that 
paper.  If so let me know so I can figure all of this out.  Normally, I figure 
things out fairly easily, but this is eluding me.  
 
If you do not want to share the information so that I can come to the same 
conclusion that you have I understand.  I am having great difficulty 
understanding what you and Li did.  I thought that this might clarify my 
confusion.  At this point, after reviewing all of the spread sheets I simply 
cannot understand all that you did.  Perhaps a phone call between me you and Li 
will get things clarified for me.  Otherwise, I am not able to write anything 
about these studies.  
 
Thanks for you help.  I am working hard to try to get this paper out as fast as 
I can and apologize for being so slow.  The move, Emily's wedding and several 
surgeries have slowed my progress, but I am back on it and want to get it off 
my desk.  Sorry to be such a bother.
 
Sincerely,

John P. Giesy

 In reply to your email to Pirn I send you hereby the part of the report that is dealing with the                                               
                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                
 selected endpoints. Three chapters are not finalised yet, that is Chapter 6, 21 and 22. In addition                                            
 there are a few lines/words highlighted in yellow. I still need to add some information there.                                                 
 Maybe I can suggest a reply before 17th of november on the endpoints you have selected. Please                                                 
 give some attention to the tabulated data on their correctness as far as you can.

 have                                                                                    
 made so far. Could you please indicate if you are available for such a

 In reply to your email to Pim I send you hereby the part of the report that is dealing with the                                                 
                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                 
 selected endpoints. Three chapters are not finalised yet, that is Chapter 6, 21 and 22. In addition                                             
 there are a few lines/words highlighted in yellow. I still need to add some information there.                                                  
 Maybe I can suggest a reply before 17th of november on the endpoints you have selected. Please                                                  
 give some attention to the tabulated data on their correctness as far as you can.

               In reply to your email to Pirn I send you hereby the part of the report that is dealing with the                                  
                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                 
               selected endpoints. Three chapters are not finalised yet, that is Chapter 6, 21 and 22. In addition                               
               there are a few lines/words highlighted in yellow. I still need to add some information there.                                    
               Maybe I can suggest a reply before 17th of november on the endpoints you have selected. Please

Good morning,Geary,congratulations to you and your colleagues for the fine job on this document. I've been very deliberate in reading the paper in order to better comprehend its contents. Hope we have a chance to discuss at some future time.
In the meanwhile, take care and try to stay in out of the snow.

FYI per our prior discussions, see the link below to the phase 1 clinical trial of PFOA manuscript that was just published as advance access in Toxicological Sciences. It is an OPEN ACCESS link so you will be able to open up the pdf without any problem.

David,
Snow? What snow? I am in Phoenix celebrating my mother’s 98th birthday. Just hope the snow is melted when I return on Monday OR that my significant other was able to start our JOhn Deere 3520 utility tractor to snow blow our 0.3 mile driveway. She is the pro at this task.
Perry was going to contact journal to find out where journal stands with 2nd review of our paper. It has been awhile.

Jo, 

Attached is the manuscript from Jennifer Field's graduate student on fluorochemicals at firefighting sites. I 
will read through it and send it again if I have any comments. As I noted in my phone message, Don 
Hagen has also forwarded copies to Dave Sanders and Bill Weppner.

Dear Mr. Hagen, 

It has been awhile since we have spoken regarding our perfluorinated 
surfactant research project here at Oregon State University. 

Our manuscript, Determination of Perfluorinated Carboxylic Acids in 
Groundwater Impacted by Fire Training Activity, is near completion and we 
intend to submit it to Environmental Science and Technology. 

I have attached a copy of the manuscript. (If the attached file is 
unretrievable/unreadable please let me know and I will forward a hardcopy to 
you.) 
We would appreciate your comments regarding the paper, preferably within a 
two week time period, thus allowing us time to consider and/or incorporate 
your comments. 

Please note that laboratory work is still in progress to complete Table 3. 
Replicate samples are being analyzed to increase the number of samples 
analyzed and allow for a more rigorous statistical evaluation of the data. 

Additionally (on a separate note), we would like to locate a laboratory that 
will perform total organof1uorine analysis in water samples using the 
oxyhydrogen torch method. We realize this is a specialized type of analysis 
such that the number of laboratories having this capability is small. Any 
help locating such a service would be most appreciated. 

Thank you in advance for your time and commentary. Please feel free to 
contact me at (541)737-5431 or Jennifer at (541)737-2267 if you have any 
questions regarding the manuscript or if you would like to further discuss 
its content. 

Enjoy the Thanksgiving holiday!

Dear Dr. Giesy,

We represent a couple of labs in Europe discussing the possibilities to
look for fluorinated compounds in the environment.We have got some of
the 3M documents on PFOS and understand you have been involved in the
analysis of this compound. Have you got any publications or reports from
that work?

Have you also been looking for other compounds? Both perfluoroheptane
and tridecafluoroiodohexane have been identified as compounds of very
high concern in the OSPAR work with hazardous substances. We also
uderstand that a large number of other perflourinated substances are
being produced and marketed for different applications.

Any information you can give us would be very much appreciated.

Best regards,
Bo Jansson

Dear Dr. Giesy, 
     Thank you for the number.  What I would ask you Tuesday is whether there
is any time next week when I could come out to talk to you.  Esquire would
like a story of some length on the subject and since you are at the heart of
it, it would be better for us to talk in person than on the phone.  If you
had time to meet, I would be very grateful.  I could fit into your schedule
in whatever way necessary.  There is no reason to stop what you might be
doing to sit down and talk.  The best way to have these discussions is
informally---in a car on your way to an appointment, in a hallway, at
lunch---in whatever fashion suits you.  In the course of several hours,
during which I might sometimes read something on the subject or otherwise
occupy myself while you're at a meeting, or in some other manner engaged.
     I think it's a wonderful story, and I was excited when Esquire called
me, and I hope it will work out.  They would like the story sooner rather
than later, which is why I am under a little bit of pressure from having a
deadline.
     In case you would like to know anything about me, I have been a writer
at The New Yorker since 1980, but I also work for Esquire and a few other
magazines when I can.  I've been a Guggenheim Fellow and have published five
books and have won a couple of literary prizes.
     Thanks. 
Yours,
Alec Wilkinson

DB:

Here is the proposed final program for the SETAC meeting.  I was pretty
successful in what I could negotiate with John.  I got rid of all of the
policy people and got spots for all of our people.  Rich still has a spot,
but politically if we did not let him speak he would make a great deal of
mileage of that in the press.  Best to let him participate and try to keep
him to the straight and narrow based on sound science.  The bal is now in our
court to do a good job.

If I am going to be any help to you I need to be involved in what Hicks does.
 He is not a toxicologist or a chemist and in 15 min can undo a lot of
background that has been laid over the past several years.  It is imperative
that he and I be on the same page and that everything he says is supportable
by sound science and that what he does is by the risk assessment process that
the agencies can relate to.  Otherwise we will start a pissing match.  That
is a road we do not want to go down.  We need to educate teh regulators not
enrage them.

Lets discuss this today.

draft on the fluorochemical study/methods and results
Body:
Geary,

We have prepared the first draft on methods/results.  Please review the
attached files.  I have decided to report the results from non-parametric
statistical analyses as the compounds.

We may need to combine some of the tables.  The figures are for your
reference - may or may not need to include them in the manuscript.

Look forward to receiving your and your colleagues' input.

Regards,
Han Yao

Dear John,
 
Thank you for your mail. Of course you know better what really happened, and I  
have to excuse, if I have overestimated your role in the PFOS history.  
However, as I see it, your reseach work and other efforts were a main  
basis for the decision by 3M at that early time. Of course, your coworkers  and 
collaborators also have played an important role but some exceptional  
individual leaders are always needed as drivers and communicators.
 
I had planned to go to Toronto, and it may  still happen. However, I have a new 
project for the DEPA on household products  and indoor climate (PFAS 
included!), which start is delayed but still has to be  finished in November. 
Before September the first part should be finished, so may  be I have to be 
home and work late August.
 
Two weeks ago I had a lecture about the PFOS  DEPA report at the annual meeting 
of the Danish Health Ministry Centre for  Environmental medicine. I was 
surprised how little people knew about these  chemicals. Some researchers, who 
have a  large epidemiological human blood bank with samples back to the  70s 
and 80s, were interested in measuring the perfluorinated chemicals also.  Thus 
may be we will make a project in Denmark studying trends.  Those blood samples 
are supposed to be tested for sex hormones  also.
 
Yours truly,
 
Allan

Thank you for the copy of the report.  I read it over the  weekend.  
 
I noticed that you mention that I was largely responsible for PFOS  production 
being ceased in 2000.  While it is true that we were working  hard and 
published the first results on concentrations in the environment and  
particularly in wildlife, it is important to note that we were doing all of  
this in close cooperation with the 3M company.  The withdrawal of the  product 
was voluntary and based on an agreement with the US EPA.   Furthermore, the 
decision was based on the results of our work as well as  that of many other 
scientists within and outside of 3M who were doing the  toxicity studies.  In 
the end it was a business decision, based on a many  factors, including the fat 
that there seemed to be replacement products that  had a better environmental 
profile.  While I was part of the team, I was  hardly even the key part of the 
team that made this decision.  It is  important to me that due credit be given 
to those who deserve it so I hope  that you will take the opportunity to dispel 
any misperception and give due  credit to my colleagues at both the 3M company 
and US EPA without whom I could  not have done any of the work we were able to 
assist with.  In this case,  it was the leadership of 3M that undertook this 
decision, without any external  pressure or coercion from me or anyone else.  I 
am just a scientist and  do not have that much influence on such decisions.  I 
just try to provide  the best possible factual information so that appropriate 
decisions can be  reached by those who have the responsibility to make such 
decisions.  I  think it was taken because 3M has always thought of themselves 
as a very  ""green"" company.  They were really surprised when they found PFOS 
to  be widespread in the environment. I agree with the decision, but was not  
so much responsible for it.  I think it was taken as a proactive step  even 
before we had the toxicological information to assess the potential for  
effects.  Now that we have that information, we realize that while it was  
unlikely that PFOS ever reached a concentration that would have resulted in  
adverse effects in wildlife, it was a prudent decision because additional  
production might have resulted in concentrations in the future that would have  
approached the threshold for effects in some species.  
 
Will you be at the Fluoros and Dioxin meetings in Toronto?  I hope  to see you 
there.
